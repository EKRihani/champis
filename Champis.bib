	abstract = {Predicting if a set of mushrooms is edible or not corresponds to the task of classifying them into two groups—edible or poisonous—on the basis of a classification rule. To support this binary task, we have collected the largest and most comprehensive attribute based data available. In this work, we detail the creation, curation and simulation of a data set for binary classification. Thanks to natural language processing, the primary data are based on a text book for mushroom identification and contain 173 species from 23 families. While the secondary data comprise simulated or hypothetical entries that are structurally comparable to the 1987 data, it serves as pilot data for classification tasks. We evaluated different machine learning algorithms, namely, naive Bayes, logistic regression, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and random forests (RF). We found that the RF provided the best results with a five-fold Cross-Validation accuracy and F2-score of 1.0 (\$\${\textbackslash}mu =1\$\$, \$\${\textbackslash}sigma =0\$\$), respectively. The results of our pilot are conclusive and indicate that our data were not linearly separable. Unlike the 1987 data which showed good results using a linear decision boundary with the LDA. Our data set contains 23 families and is the largest available. We further provide a fully reproducible workflow and provide the data under the FAIR principles.},

@article{bergstra_random_nodate,
	title = {Random {Search} for {Hyper}-{Parameter} {Optimization}},
	abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efﬁcient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to conﬁgure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks conﬁgured by a pure grid search, we ﬁnd that random search over the same domain is able to ﬁnd models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search ﬁnds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising conﬁguration space. Compared with deep belief networks conﬁgured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional conﬁguration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for conﬁguring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent “High Throughput” methods achieve surprising success—they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

	abstract = {This article reviews recent progress in understanding the mechanics of hyphal growth. The pressurization of hyphae by osmosis is often considered an important feature of the tip growth process. But although the hydrostatic pressure within the cytoplasm smooths the expanding surface of these cells, there is little evidence that high levels of turgor are necessary for growth until the hypha encounters friction from its surroundings. Research on movement and growth processes in other kinds of cells, including amoebae and pollen tubes, has done a great deal to inform recent studies on hyphae. Experiments on pressure waves and rhythmic or pulsatile growth are particularly significant and are discussed in relation to the erratic extension rate of hyphae. Significant findings have also come from research on the hyphal cytoskeleton and on the biomechanics of invasive growth. It has been clear for some time that turgor powers the propulsion of hyphae through solid materials and experiments using new techniques have quantified the relevant forces.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the mechanical and material properties of hyphae, the single constituent material of Agaricomycetes fungi, despite a growing interest in fungus-based materials. In the Agaricomycetes (the mushrooms and allies), there are three types of hyphae that make up sporocarps: generative, skeletal, and ligative. All filamentous Agaricomycetes can be categorized into one of three categories of hyphal systems that compose them: monomitic, dimitic, and trimitic. Monomitic systems have only generative hyphae. Dimitic systems have generative and either skeletal (most common) or ligative. Trimitic systems are composed of all three kinds of hyphae. SEM imaging, compression testing, and theoretical modeling were used to characterize the material and mechanical properties of representative monomitic, dimitic, and trimitic sporocarps. Compression testing revealed an increase in the compression modulus and compressive strength with the addition of more hyphal types (monomitic to dimitic and dimitic to trimitic). The mesostructure of the trimitic sporocarp was tested and modeled, suggesting that the difference in properties between the solid material and the microtubule mesostructure is a result of differences in structure and not material. Theoretical modeling was completed to estimate the mechanical properties of the individual types of hyphae and showed that skeletal hyphae make the largest contribution to mechanical properties of fungal sporocarps. Understanding the contributions of the different types of hyphae may help in the design and application of fungi-based or bioinspired materials.
Statement of Significance
This research studies the material and mechanical properties of fungal sporocarps and their hyphae, the single constituent material of Agaricomycetes fungi. Though some work has been done on fungal hyphae, this research studies hyphae in context of the three hyphal systems found in Agaricomycetes fungi and estimates the properties of the hyphal filaments, which has not been done previously. This characterization was performed by analyzing the structures and mechanical properties of fungal sporocarps and calculating the theoretical mechanical properties of their hyphae. This data and the resulting conclusions may lead to a better design and implementation process of fungi-based materials in various applications using the properties now known or calculated.},
