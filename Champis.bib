	abstract = {Objective:
Oxidative stress plays an important role in the development of diabetic complications including metabolic abnormality-induced diabetic micro-vascular and macro-vascular complications. Urtica dioica L. (U. dioica) has been traditionally used in Iranian medicine as an herbal remedy for hypoglycemic or due to its anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of hydro-alcoholic extract of U. dioica on blood lipids, hepatic enzymes and nitric oxide levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 

Materials and Methods:
50 women with type 2 diabetes participated in this study and were randomly divided into two groups namely, control and intervention groups. Control group received placebo and intervention group received hydro-alcoholic extract of U. dioica. Before and after 8 weeks of continuous treatment, some biochemical serum levels including FPG, TG, SGPT, SGOT, HDL, LDL, SOD and NO were measured. 

Results:
The results indicated that after 8 weeks, in the intervention group, FPG, TG, and SGPT levels significantly decreased and HDL, NO and SOD levels significantly increased as compared to the control group. 

Conclusion:
Our results encourage the use of hydro-alcoholic extract of U. dioica as an antioxidant agent for additional therapy of diabetes as hydro-alcoholic extract of U. dioica may decrease risk factors of cardiovascular incidence and other complications in patients with diabetes mellitus.},

Methods: In a double-blinded randomized controlled trial, patients were treated for 7 weeks then followed up 4 weeks. Seventy-two postmenopausal women who reported at least 20 hot flashes attacks per week were randomly allocated into one of the 4 groups of Urtica dioica 450 mg/day and acupuncture 11 sessions (A), acupuncture and placebo (B), sham acupuncture and Urtica dioica (C), and sham acupuncture and placebo (D). The primary outcomes were the change in hot flashes score from baseline to the end of treatment and follow up; and the change in the quality of life (MENQOL) from baseline to the end of treatment. Secondary outcomes included changes in FSH, LH, and ESTRADIOL levels from baseline to the end of treatment. The trial was conducted from October 2017 to July 2018 in Acupuncture clinic of a teaching hospital in Iran.
Results: A total of 72 women 45–60 years old were enrolled, and 68 were included in the analyses. The median (IQR) hot flashes score decreased in the A group by 20.2 (31.7) and 21.1 (25.1), B group by 19 (18) and 17.3 (27), C group by 14.6 (25.4) and 20.8 (13), and D group by 1.6 (11.6) and 1 (13.3) at the end of treatment and follow up (P {\textless} 0.0001, P {\textless} 0.0001); no significant difference between A, B and C groups. The mean (SD) of MENQOL score decreased in the A group by 42.6 (21.1), B group by 40.7 (29.8), C group by 37.8 (26.8) and D group by 9.8 (14.3) at the end of treatment (P = 0.001); no significant difference between A, B and C groups.
Conclusions: Urtica dioica can decrease menopausal hot flashes and increase the quality of life of postmenopausal women better than placebo-sham control but same as acupuncture. The combination of Urtica dioica and acupuncture did not add to the effects of those therapies.},

These bacteria demonstrated not only benefits for plant growth, but also extreme tolerance to As, Zn and Pb. Despite these results, the native phytoremediation potential of nettles could be improved by biotechnologies. Transient expression was used to investigate the functionality of the most common constitutive promoter, CaMV 35S in Urtica dioica. This showed the expression of the CUP and bphC transgenes.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Urtica dioica and Eryngium spp. have been used in traditional medicine for many years. In spite of many works, nothing is known about their protective effect against hypoxia-induced lethality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Protective effects of U. dioica (UD) aerial parts and E. caucasicum (EC) inflorescence against hypoxia-induced lethality in mice were evaluated by three experimental models of hypoxia, asphyctic, haemic and circulatory.
RESULTS: Statistically significant protective activities were established in some doses of extracts in three models. Antihypoxic activity was especially pronounced in polyphenol fractions in asphyctic model. EC polyphenol fraction at 400 mg/kg prolonged survival time (48.80 ± 4.86, p {\textless} 0.001) which was comparable with that of phenytoin (p {\textgreater} 0.05). It was the most effective extract in circulatory model, too. It prolonged survival time significantly respect to control group (p {\textless} 0.001). UD extracts protected the mice but the response was not dose-dependent. In haemic model, extracts of EP signiﬁcantly and dose dependently prolonged survival time as compared to control group (p {\textless} 0.001). At 600 mg/kg, EP was the most effective one, being capable of keeping the mice alive for 12.71 ± 0.75 min. Only the concentration of 300 mg/kg of UD was effective (p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Extracts showed remarkable antihypoxic effects. Pharmacological effects may be attributed to the presence of polyphenols in the extracts.},

	abstract = {Objective
Excess dietary lipids result in the accumulation of lipid metabolites including ceramides that can attenuate insulin signaling. There is evidence that a botanical extract of Urtica dioica L. (stinging nettle) improves insulin action, yet the precise mechanism(s) are not known. Hence, we examined the effects of Urtica dioica L. (UT) on adipocytes.

Research Design
We investigated the effects of an ethanolic extract of UT on free fatty acid (palmitic acid) induced inhibition of insulin-stimulated Akt serine phosphorylation and modulation of ceramidase expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Adipocytes were exposed to excess FFAs in the presence or absence of UT. Effects on adiponectin expression, ceramidase expression, ceramidase activity, ceramide accumulation and insulin signaling were determined.

Results
As expected, FFAs reduced adiponectin expression and increased the expression of ceramidase enzymes but not their activity. FFA also induced the accumulation of ceramides and reduced insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt in adipocytes. The effects of FFA were partially reversed by UT. UT enhanced adiponectin expression and ceramidase activity in the presence of excess FFAs. UT abated ceramide accumulation and increased insulin sensitivity via enhanced Akt phosphorylation. A siRNA knockdown of adiponectin expression prevented UT from exerting positive effects on ceramidase activity but not Akt phosphorylation.

Conclusions
In adipocytes, the ability of UT to antagonize the negative effects of FFA by modulating ceramidase activity and ceramide accumulation is dependent on the presence of adiponectin. However, the ability of UT to enhance Akt phosphorylation is independent of adiponectin expression. These studies demonstrate direct effects of UT on adipocytes and suggest this botanical extract is metabolically beneficial.},

STZ induced diabetic mice showed significant decrease in hippocampal insulin signaling and translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) to neuronal membrane resulting in cognitive dysfunction and hypolocomotion. UD treatment effectively improved hippocampal insulin signaling, glucose tolerance and recognition memory performance in diabetic mice, which was comparable to ROSI. Further, diabetes mediated oxidative stress and inflammation was reversed by chronic UD or ROSI administration.

Hyperglycemia promotes oxidative stress that plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Diabetic nephropathy (DN). In this study, we investigated the synergism effects of hydroalcoholic extract of Urtica dioica and pioglitazone (PIO) on the prevention of DN in streptozotocin induced-diabetic mice.

Materials and Methods:
Forty-two mice were divided into six groups as follows: non-diabetic control group, DMSO group (as solvent), diabetic group and four treatment groups which received U. dioica, pioglitazone, U. dioica plus pioglitazone and vitE. Diabetes was induced by a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) (200 mg/kg body wt, IP) diluted in citrate buffer (pH= 4.6). After 4 weeks treatment, all animals were anaesthetized and blood was collected for serum urea and creatinine levels assessment in plasma and kidney tissue were excised for evaluation of oxidative stress markers.

Results:
Treatment with U. dioica significantly inhibited increase in serum urea and creatinine in plasma that were observed in diabetic mice. Furthermore, the elevated level of oxidative stress markers (glutathione oxidation, lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonyl) in renal supernatant of diabetic mice was inhibited by U. dioica treatment. Interestingly, U. dioica promoted beneficial effects of PIO in reducing STZ-induced hyperglycemia, renal damage and oxidative stress markers.

Conclusion:
Our findings showed that PIO plus U. dioica have synergism protective effects against STZ-induced nephropathy that can be a candidate as a therapeutic approach in order to treatment of DN.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the possible protective role of nettle Urtica dioica (UD) against Hg-induced toxicity.

Materials and Methods:
A total of 28 rats were equally divided into four groups: the control, the Hg (0.8 g HgCl2/kg in the diet), the UD (1.5 ml UD/rat by gavage), and the Hg+UD group. HgCl2 was daily dissolved in distilled water and immediately mixed with the standard diet. A solution of daily infused fresh nettle leaves in boiling water (16 g in 25 ml) was obtained and then it was administrated by gavage. Biochemical and reproductive markers, in addition to glutathione (GSH) level (liver, kidney and testis) and the histological profiles (testis and epididymis) were evaluated after 1 month exposure.

Results:
Compared to the control, the levels of glucose, triglycerides, urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were significantly raised in the Hg group. In the latter group, the concentrations of Mg, Fe, and Ca were significantly decreased. Besides, Hg+UD group has only showed raised AST activity and reduced Mg level. Concerning the fertility markers, Hg has provoked a significant decrease in the spermatozoa’s concentration and motility and in plasma testosterone level as well. Furthermore, hepatic, renal and testicular GSH concentrations have declined significantly in the Hg treated rat compared to the control. A remarkable enhancement of the GSH level was observed in all organs of the UD group. The histological examinations of the Hg group have revealed marked testicular degeneration of the most seminiferous tubules, and showed few sperms in the lumen of epididymis ducts. However, the Hg+UD rats have demonstrated an improved histological structure with the presence of important numbers of sperms in the lumen. In addition, a clear stabilization of organized seminiferous tubules and an increased sperms’ numbers were noted in the UD supplemented rats.

Conclusion:
Nettle leaves have not only played a clear protective role during Hg intoxication, but it also enhanced hepatic, renal and testicular GSH level of Wistar rats.},

(46.15\%) in group 2, and 2 (13.3\%) in group 3 at the end of the 22nd week. Although group
3 had lower palpable tumor number than group 2, the difference was not statistically
significant (p=0.096).,  The results showed that UD constituents may have effects on lipid peroxidation and some
antioxidant enzyme activities, and may slow the formation of mammary tumor.},

CUS signiﬁcantly induced body weight loss (p {\textless} 0.05) and associative memory impairment in step down task (p {\textless} 0.05) as compared to control mice. CUS signiﬁcantly downregulated Smo (p {\textless} 0.05), Gli1 (p {\textless} 0.01), cyclin D1 (p {\textless} 0.05), BDNF (p {\textless} 0.01), TrKB (p {\textless} 0.01) and MAPK1 (p {\textless} 0.01) mRNA expression in hippocampus as compared to control mice.

	abstract = {Objective: To determine whether systemically given stinging nettle (SN) has an effect on bone formation in response to expansion of the rat inter-premaxillary suture. Materials and methods: A total of 28 male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into 4 equal groups: control (C), only expansion (OE), SN extract given only during the expansion and retention periods (SN group; a total of 17 days), and SN extract given during the nursery phase before expansion (a period of 40 days) and during the expansion and retention periods (N + SN group; a total of 57 days). After the 5-day expansion period was completed, the rats in the OE, SN, and N + SN groups underwent 12 days of mechanical retention, after which they were sacriﬁced, and their premaxilla were dissected and ﬁxed. A histologic evaluation was done to determine the number of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and capillaries, as well as the number and intensity of inﬂammatory cells and new bone formation.
Results: Statistically signiﬁcant differences were found between the groups in all histologic parameters except the ratio of intensities of inﬂammatory cells. New bone formation and the number of capillaries were signiﬁcantly higher in the SN groups than in the other groups. The statistical analysis also showed that the numbers of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and capillaries were highest in the N + SN group.
Conclusion: Systemic administration of SN may be effective in accelerating new bone formation and reducing inﬂammation in the maxillary expansion procedure. It may also be beneﬁcial in preventing relapse after the expansion procedure.},

To improve the knowledge on nettle and enhance its opportunities of exploitation, a draft transcriptome of the “clone 13” (a fibre clone) is here presented. The transcriptome of whole internodes sampled at the top and middle of the stem is then compared with the core and cortical tissues sampled at the bottom. Young internodes show an enrichment in genes involved in the biosynthesis of phytohormones (auxins and jasmonic acid) and secondary metabolites (flavonoids). The core of internodes collected at the bottom of the stem is enriched in genes partaking in different aspects of secondary cell wall formation (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin biosynthesis), while the cortical tissues reveal the presence of a C starvation signal probably due to the UDP‐glucose demand necessary for the thickening phase of bast fibres. Cell wall analysis indicates a difference in rhamnogalacturonan structure/composition of mature bast fibres, as evidenced by the higher levels of galactose measured, as well as the occurrence of more water‐soluble pectins in elongating internodes. The targeted quantification of phenolics shows that the middle internode and the cortical tissues at the bottom have higher contents than top internodes. Ultrastructural analyses reveal the presence of a gelatinous layer in bast fibres with a lamellar structure. The data presented will be an important resource and reference for future molecular studies on a neglected fibre crop.},

Urtica dioica is a flowering plant with long history of use in folk medicine and as a food source.

Objectives:
This study examined in vitro antibacterial potential of alcoholic extracts of U. dioica.

Materials and Methods:
Hydroalcoholic extracts from aerial parts were prepared using aqueous solution of ethanol and methanol and their inhibitory effects against clinical isolates was examined by disc diffusion method at different doses. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) indexes were also investigated. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was also performed to find structural changes of affected bacteria consequent to exposing with extracts.

Results:
Both extracts were active against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli with respectively 16, 10, 18, and 14 mm (methanolic) and 11, 9, 17, and 16 mm (ethanolic) inhibition zone. The MIC of ethanolic extract against S. epidermidis and E. coli was respectively 10 and 40 mg/mL. The MIC of methanolic extract against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was 40 and 10 mg/mL, respectively. The MBC was found only for S. epidermidis (20 mg/mL). In SEM analysis the round shape of S. epidermidis was changed and irregular shapes were appeared, which suggest that the main target of these extracts was cell wall.

Conclusions:
Extracts of U. dioica showed significant antibacterial effect against some clinically important pathogenic bacteria. Based on the obtained results it can be concluded that U. dioica is useful as antibacterial and bactericidal agent in treating infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Currently, because the prevalence of breast cancer and its consequent mortality has increased enormously in the female population, a number of studies have been designed to identify natural products with special antitumor properties. The main purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of Urtica dioica on triggering apoptosis and diminishing growth, size, and weight of the tumor in an allograft model of BALB/c mice.
Materials and Methods
In the present study, a BALB/c mouse model of breast cancer (4T1) was used. After emergence of tumor, 2 groups of mice received the extract, 1 group at a dose of 10 mg/kg and 1 group at a dose of 20 mg/kg, by intraperitoneal injection for 28 days. During the test and after removal of the tumor mass, the size and weight of the tumor were measured. To assess the induction of apoptosis in the cancer cells, the TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling) assay was performed. The Ki-67 test was used to evaluate tumor proliferation.
Results
The results showed that the tumor size in the mice treated with the extract decreased significantly. The weight of the tumor mass in the treated mice after resection was less than that in the control group. The TUNEL assay findings revealed that apoptosis occurred in the treated group. The Ki-67 test findings also demonstrated that administration of the extract suppressed the growth of tumor cells.
Conclusion
These results suggest that U. dioica extract can decrease the growth of breast tumors and induce apoptosis in tumor cells; thus, it might represent an ideal therapeutic tool for breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Background
Urtica dioica has traditionally been used in the management of cardiovascular disorders especially hypertension. The aim of this study was to explore pharmacological base of its use in hypertension.

Methods
Crude methanolic extract of U. dioica (Ud.Cr) and its fractions (Ud.EtAc, Ud.nHex, Ud.Chl and Ud.Aq) were tested in vivo on normotensive and hypertensive rats under anesthesia for blood pressure lowering effect. In-vitro experiments on rat and rabbit aortae were employed to probe the vasorelaxation mechanism(s). The responses were measured using pressure and force transducers connected to PowerLab Data Acquisition System.

Results
Ud.Cr and fractions were found more effective antihypertensive in hypertensive rats than normotensive with remarkable potency exhibited by the ethyl acetate fraction. The effect was same in the presence of atropine. In isolated rat aortic rings, Ud.Cr and all its fractions exhibited l-NAME sensitive endothelium-dependent vasodilator effect and also inhibit K+ (80 mM)-induced pre-contractions. In isolated rabbit thoracic aortic rings Ud.Cr and its fractions induced relaxation with more potency against K+ (80 mM) than phenylephrine (1 µM) like verapamil, showing Ud.EtAc fraction the most potent one. Pre-incubation of aortic rings with Ud.Cr and its fractions exhibited Ca2+ channel blocking activity comparable with verapamil by shifting Ca2+ concentration response curves to the right. Ud.Cr and its fractions also ablated the intracellular Ca2+ release by suppressing PE peak formation in Ca2+ free medium. When tested on basal tension, the crude extract and all fractions were devoid of any vasoconstrictor effect.

Conclusions
These data indicate that crude methanolic extract and its fractions possess antihypertensive effect. Identification of NO-mediated vasorelaxation and calcium channel blocking effects explain the antihypertensive potential of U. dioica and provide a potential pharmacological base to its medicinal use in the management of hypertension.},

	abstract = {Imidacloprid (IMI) is a widely used in Tunisia and abroad, and high doses of IMI have been known to cause endocrine disruption. Some reports claim that Urtica urens L. (UU) can reduce toxicity thanks to it anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, but there is no scientific evidence justifying its use, which lets us think to its direct effect on the metabolism of the ovarian tissue. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the protective effect of UU against the toxicity of Confidor®, whose active substance is imidacloprid (IMI), in female rat, as well as the chemical compositions of UU ethanol (EtOH) extract by GC–MS. Female rats were divided into control group, 3 groups treated with IMI at 50, 200 or 300mg/kg/day and three groups co-treated with IMI (50, 200 or 300mg/kg/day)+100mg/kg/day of UU, for 60days. Blood samples were collected for the dosage of 17β-estradiol levels. Ovaries were removed for tissular dosage of malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), glutathione (GSH), vitamin E, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Histological and histomorphometric examinations were performed as well. IMI caused an acute ovary injury, increased the ovary tissue levels of MDA and AOPP, and decreased the levels of GSH, vitamin E, and antioxidant enzyme activities. The number and the diameter of follicles were markedly diminished together with a reduction of the relative weight of ovaries. Compared with controls, the treated rats exhibited a significant reduction in serum 17b-estradiol levels. These results suggest an endocrine disruption by IMI which may interfere with ovarian follicles development in rat. The injection of UU EtOH extract improved the histological and all biochemical parameters cited above. In conclusion, IMI induced an acute ovary injury accompanied with disturbance of oxidant status and causes follicular atresia. Significant antioxidant activities were also observed in UU EtOH and a total of 31 compounds were identified. The injection of UU EtOH provided a significant protection which might be due to its antioxidant activities.},

After 25 days, blood and tissue samples were collected for haematological and histopathological analysis, respectively. The oxidative stress parameters were evaluated in the lungs, liver and erythrocytes. Then, correlations between markers of airway inflammation and markers of oxidative stress were explored., Results: UD extract significantly (p {\textless} 0.01) inhibited eosinophilia increases in BALF (−60\%) and the levels of leucocytes (−32.75\%) and lymphocytes (−29.22\%) in serum, and effectively suppressed inflammatory cells recruitment in the asthmatic rat model.

	abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder and has been associated with cognitive dysfunction. In our earlier study, chronic Urtica dioica (UD) treatment significantly ameliorated diabetes induced associative and spatial memory deficit in mice. The present study was designed to explore the effect of UD leaves extract on muscarinic cholinergic system, which has long been known to be involved in cognition. Streptozotocin (STZ) (50 mg/kg, i.p., consecutively for 5 days) was used to induce diabetes followed by treatment with UD extract (50 mg/kg, oral) or rosiglitazone (5 mg/kg, oral) for 8 weeks. STZ-induced diabetic mice showed significant reduction in hippocampal muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-1 and choline acetyltransferase expressions. Chronic diabetes significantly up-regulated the protein expression of acetylcholinesterase associated with oxidative stress in hippocampus. Besides, STZ-induced diabetic mice showed hypolocomotion with up-regulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-4 expression in striatum. Chronic UD treatment significantly attenuated the cholinergic dysfunction and oxidative stress in the hippocampus of diabetic mice. UD had no effect on locomotor activity and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-4 expression in striatum. In conclusion, UD leaves extract has potential to reverse diabetes mediated alteration in muscarinic cholinergic system in hippocampus and thereby improve memory functions.},

The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strains NEAU-PCY-1T and NEAU-PCY-2 exhibited 99.8\% similarity with each other and are closely related to Streptomyces abietis DSM 42080T (98.2, 98.3\%) and Streptomyces fildesensis DSM 41987T (98.0, 98.1\%). Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the two strains formed a cluster with these two closely related species. Moreover, DNA–DNA hybridization results and some phenotypic, physiological and biochemical properties differentiated the two strains from their close relatives in the genus Streptomyces. Based on a polyphasic taxonomy study, strains NEAU-PCY-1T and NEAU-PCY-2 are considered to represent a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces urticae sp. nov. is proposed, with NEAU-PCY-1T (= DSM 105115T = CCTCC AA 2017015T) as the type strain.},

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer has a high prevalence among women worldwide. Tumor invasion and metastasis still remains an open issue that causes most of the therapeutic failures and remains the prime cause of patient mortality. Hence, there is an unmet need to develop the most effective therapeutic approach with the lowest side effects and highest cytotoxicity that will effectively arrest or eradicate metastasis.
Methods: An MTT assay and scratch test were used to assess the cytotoxicity and migration effects of Urtica dioica on the breast cancer cells. The QRT-PCR was used to study the expression levels of miR-21, MMP1, MMP9, MMP13, CXCR4, vimentin, and E-cadherin.
Results: The results of gene expression in tumoral groups conﬁrmed the overexpression of miR-21, MMP1, MMP9, MMP13, vimentin, and CXCR4, and the lower expression of E-cadherin compared to control groups (P {\textless} 0.05). Moreover, the results of the MTT assay show that Urtica dioica signiﬁcantly inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, ﬁndings from the scratch assay exhibited the inhibitory effects of Urtica dioica on the migration of breast cancer cell lines.
Conclusion: Urtica dioica extract could inhibit cancer cell migration by regulating miR-21, MMP1, MMP9, MMP13, vimentin, CXCR4, and E-Cadherin. Moreover, our ﬁndings demonstrated that the extract could decrease miR-21 expression, which substantially lessens the overexpressed MMP1, MMP9, MMP13, vimentin, and CXCR4 and increases E-cadherin in the tumoral group.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the synergic effect of Urtica dioica extract in combination with paclitaxel on cell death and invasion of human breast cancer MDA-MB-468 cell line. Materials and methods: To determine the cytotoxic effects of Urtica dioica extract with paclitaxel, MTT assay was performed. The scratch test was exploited to assess the effects of Urtica dioica, Paclitaxel alone and combination on migration of cancer cells. The expression levels of snail-1, ZEB1, ZEB2, twist, Cdc2, cyclin B1 and Wee1 genes were quantiﬁed using qRT-PCR and western blot performed for snail1expression. The effects of plant extract, Paclitaxel alone and combination on different phases of cell cycle was analyzed using ﬂow cytometry.
Results: Results of MTT assay showed that Urtica dioica signiﬁcantly destroyed cancer cells. Interestingly, Concurrent use of Urtica dioica extract with paclitaxel resulted in decreased IC50 dose of paclitaxel. Moreover, ﬁndings of scratch assay exhibited the inhibitory effects of Urtica dioica, Paclitaxel alone and combination on migration of MDA-MB-468 cell line. Our ﬁndings also demonstrated that the extract substantially decreased the Snail-1 and related gene expression. Ultimately, Cell cycle arrest occurred at G2/M phase post-treatment by deregulating Cdc2 and wee1.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that the dichloromethane extract of Urtica dioica inhibit cell growth and migration. Also, Urtica dioica extract substantially increased sensitivity of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel. Therefore, it can be used as a potential candidate for treatment of breast cancer with paclitaxel.},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major health problem, worldwide, that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Several randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) have investigated the effect of nettle (Urtica dioica) supplementation on markers of glycemic status in patients with T2DM, with conflicting results. Therefore, the present study assessed the effect of nettle on some glycemic parameters in patients with T2DM. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, from database inception up to June 2019, to identify RCTs investigating the effect of nettle supplementation on glycemic markers, including fasting blood sugar (FBS) concentrations, insulin levels, homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance index, and glycosylated hemoglobin percentage in adults with T2DM. The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Results of this meta-analysis were reported based on the random effects model. Eight RCTs, comprising 401 participants, were included in the present systematic review and meta-analysis. Based on the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool, five studies were considered as good quality, one was fair, and two studies were poor, respectively. The results of the meta-analysis revealed a significant reduction in FBS concentrations (weighted mean difference [WMD]: −18.01 mg/dl, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: −30.04 to −5.97, p {\textless} .001, I2 = 94.6\%) following nettle supplementation. However, no significant reduction was observed in insulin levels (WMD: 0.83 Hedges' g, 95\% CI: −0.26 to 1.92, p = .13, I2 = 89.4\%), homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance index (WMD: −0.22, 95\% CI: −0.83 to 0.40, p = .49, I2 = 69.2\%), or glycosylated hemoglobin percentage (WMD: −0.77\%, 95\% CI: −1.77 to 0.22, p = .12, I2 = 83.0\%). The findings of the present study suggest that nettle supplementation may be effective in controlling FBS for T2DM patients. However, further studies are needed to confirm the veracity of these results.},

	abstract = {Objective: Finding compounds that could be used for prevention of atherosclerosis (AS) is highly desired. The present study evaluated the protective effects of Urtica dioica (UD, commonly known as stinging nettle) leaf ethanolic extract against high-fat diet-induced AS in rats.
Materials and Methods: In this study, 40 male adult Sprauge-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to 4 equal groups and treated as follows for 9 consecutive weeks: (1) Normal control (NC; normal rats that were fed with a basic diet); (2) Atherosclerotic rats (AT; which received no particular treatment); (3) Atherosclerotic rats that received 100 mg/kg/day ethanolic extract of UD orally and (4) Atherosclerotic rats that received simvastatin 4 mg/kg/day orally. Atherosclerosis was induced by a high-fat diet accompanied by propylthiouracil and vitamin D3.
Results: Marked hypercholesterolemia and significant increase in LDL-C/HDL-C ratio were observed in rats of AT group. Administration of UD significantly reduced these parameters as compared to AT group (p{\textless}0.05 for all cases). In histopathological evaluations of the aortic arch, AT rats showed atherosclerotic lesions, which were markedly ameliorated in rats treated with UD or simvastatin. Simvastatin and UD significantly reduced medial (p{\textless}0.05) but not intimal thickness. Increased level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were observed in the aortic arch of AT rats (p{\textless}0.05 for all cases). In contrast with simvastatin, UD extract had no significant effect on these parameters.
Conclusion: Ethanolic extract of UD prevents establishment of atherosclerotic lesions in rat aorta, which is associated with positive effects on serum lipid profile without significantly affecting antioxidant status.},

OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the leaves of Urtica urens in ethanol (EtOH) and water (WA) solvents, employing standard analytical methods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polyphenol, flavonoid and tannin content of Urtica urens leaves were determined, after their extraction, using EtOH (70\%) and WA extracts as well as the antioxidant (DPPH, ABTS, β-carotene and FRAP) and the antibacterial (via the method of dilution tests) activities of EtOH and WA extracts.
RESULTS: The 70\% EtOH of Urtica urens showed the highest values of total phenolic (31.41 mg GAE/g DW), flavonoids (6.81 mg quercetin/g DW), tannin (8.29 mg GAE/g DW) and TEAC (560 mmol Trolox/g DW), compared to the WA. The results of DPPH for EtOH (95.56\%) were higher than that of WA (64.56\%) at a concentration of 40 mg/L. The extracts displayed a FRAP 106.23 for EtOH and 30.55 μmol Fe(II)/g DW for WA. The results clearly indicated that EtOH was the strongest radical scavenger (IC50 = 245.65 ± 10.2 μg/mL). Ethanol was the most effective with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) {\textless} 250 μg/mL. WA has no antibacterial activity.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results indicate that leaves of Urtica urens could be used as natural antioxidant and antimicrobial agents.},

This study evaluated the therapeutic effects of the Urtica dioica L (U. dioica) aqueous extract as an anti-leishmanial herbal drug in-vitro and in-vivo, and in addition to that, evaluated two vital immune system cytokines including gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) plus nitric oxide (NO) and arginase activity against Leishmania major (L. major) infected mice.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In-vitro anti-leishmanial activity of U. dioica aqueous extract was determined using MTT method and also Parasite Rescue Transformation Assay. Also, the footpad lesion size and parasite load in BALB/c mice infected with L. major were quantified for in-vivo assessment. Furthermore, for evaluating the immune responses, the levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, NO and arginase were measured in the BALB/c mice. These results indicated that U. dioica extract significantly reduced the L. major promastigotes viability. According to the in-vitro cytotoxicity assay of the extract on Leishmania parasites (CC50) and infected macrophages (EC50), the extract had no toxicity to the macrophages, however it efficiently killed the L. major amastigotes. In addition, the lesion size, parasite load, IL-4, and ARG were decreased in the treated infected mice, however IFN-γ and NO were significantly increased.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study established satisfactory results in Leishmania parasite clearing both in-vivo and in-vitro. Therefore, U. dioica extract can be considered as an effective and harmless herbal compound for killing the parasite without toxicity to the host macrophages. Furthermore, it also can treat the CL by switching the mouse immune response towards a cell-mediated response (Th1); hence, it may be identified as a perfect therapeutic herbal drug for CL treatment.},

	abstract = {Background
Urtica dioica is known as an anti-hyperglycemic plant. Urtica dioica distillate (UD) is a traditional Iranian drink, locally known as “aragh gazaneh”. In spite of its widespread consumption in Iran, according to traditional Iranian medicine, there is no scientific report on the usefulness of UD for diabetic patients. This survey was designed to evaluate its protective effects for the recovery from diabetes by determining the serum insulin, blood glucose, volume of pancreatic islets, and the number and volume of β-cells in diabetic rats.

Methods
A total of 48 Sprague-Dawley male rats (200-250 g) were randomly distributed into 6 groups (n=8), including non-diabetic plus distilled water (DW), non-diabetic plus UD, diabetic plus DW, diabetic plus UD, diabetic plus insulin, and diabetic plus glibenclamide. DW, UD, and glibenclamide were administered via intragastric gavage and insulin was injected subcutaneously. After four weeks of experiments, blood samples were collected for serum insulin and blood glucose assay. Pancreas was also evaluated using stereological method. The SPSS software was used for statistical analysis. Kruskal-Wallis, repeated measurements, and Mann-Whitney U test were applied for comparisons between the groups.

Results
The treatment of diabetic rats with UD reduced the blood glucose dramatically (P{\textless}0.001) and increased serum insulin levels significantly (P=0.03) in comparison to the diabetic plus DW rats. Treatment with UD did not affect the mean β-cell volumes in the diabetic rats when compared to the diabetic plus DW rats, but the islet volumes and β-cell numbers were significantly recovered.

Conclusion
UD treatment in diabetic rats improves hyperglycemia by partially restoring plasma insulin levels. The data suggest that UD prevents islet atrophy and/or regenerate pancreatic β-cells.},

This study reports the health benefits and biological activities of the Urtica dioica (U. dioica) edible plant, with particular focus on its cancer chemopreventive potential. Numerous studies have attempted to investigate the most efficient anti-cancer therapy with few side effects and high toxicity on cancer cells to overcome the chemoresistance of cancer cells and the adverse effects of current therapies. In this regard, natural products from edible plants have been assessed as sources of anti-cancer agents. In this article, we review current knowledge from studies that have examined the cytotoxic, anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects of U. dioica plant on several human cancers. Special attention has been dedicated to the treatment of breast cancer, the most prevalent cancer among women and one of the main causes of death worldwide. The anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of U. dioica have been demonstrated on different human cancers, investigating the properties of U. dioica at cellular and molecular levels. The potent cytotoxicity and anti-cancer activity of the U. dioica extracts are due to its bioactive natural products content, including polyphenols which reportedly possess anti-oxidant, anti-mutagenic and anti-proliferative properties. The efficacy of this edible plant to prevent or mitigate human cancers has been demonstrated in laboratory conditions as well as in experimental animal models, paving the way to the development of nutraceuticals for new anti-cancer therapies.},

	abstract = {Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica L.) has been used as herbal medicine to treat various ailments since ancient times. The biological activity of nettle is chiefly attributed to a large group of phenylpropanoid dimers, namely lignans. Despite the pharmacological importance of nettle lignans, there are no studies addressing lignan biosynthesis in this plant. We herein identified 14 genes encoding dirigent proteins (UdDIRs) and 3 pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase genes (UdPLRs) in nettle, which are two gene families known to be associated with lignan biosynthesis. Expression profiling of these genes on different organs/tissues revealed a specific expression pattern. Particularly, UdDIR7, 12 and 13 displayed a remarkable high expression in the top internode, fibre tissues of bottom internodes and roots, respectively. The relatively high expression of UdPLR1 and UdPLR2 in the young internodes, core tissue of bottom internode and roots is consistent with the high accumulation of lariciresinol and secoisolariciresinol in these tissues. Lignan quantification showed a high abundance of pinoresinol in roots and pinoresinol diglucosides in young internodes and leaves. This study sheds light on lignan composition and biosynthesis in nettle, providing a good basis for further functional analysis of DIRs and PLRs and, ultimately, engineering lignan metabolism in planta and in cell cultures.},

After six weeks, volume and weight of each lobe were measured and samples were taken. The 5 to 6 µm thickness sections were made using paraffin embedding method and stained by hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff. The results showed that prostate volume and ratio of prostate to body weight were increased significantly in the testosterone. Histological and histometrical results showed that dorsal and lateral type 1 and 2 lobes were not changed significantly but the ventral and anterior lobes have changed significantly. Over all, the nettle root could prevent from some of prostatic hyperplasia effects, so that percentage of folded alveoli in ventral lobe reduced insignificantly.},

Several ethnobotanical studies have indicated that the use of nettle slurry as fertilizer in organic farming for horticultural crops is spreading. Sometimes, however, the consequences of using these natural products have been poorly evaluated, and there is very little scientific evidence for the effects of using these slurries. In this study, we aimed to analyze the possible effect of nettle slurry on potato yields produced by organic farming. To achieve this main objective, we assessed the effect of nettle slurry on potato yields, plant size and growth parameters, chlorophyll content, and the presence of pests and diseases. Different slurry doses were assessed in 36 plots and nine variables were measured during the crop cycle. Under these field experimental conditions, nettle slurry (including one treatment with Urtica in combination with Equisetum) had no significant effects on yield, chlorophyll content, or the presence of pests and diseases in organic potato crops. The highest chlorophyll content was found in the double dose treatment, but the difference was not significant. This result, together with a small improvement in plant height with the double dose treatment, might indicate very slight crop enhancement which, under our experimental conditions, was not enough to improve yield. The Urtica and Equisetum slurry chemical analyses showed very low levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.},

Stinging Nettle (Urtica dioica) is a unique herbaceous perennial ﬂowering plant with stinging hairs. The leaf extract of nettle was one of the herbal remedies which the experimental, clinical and trials have complemented each other. It is a very well-known plant with a wide historical background use of stems, leaves and roots. It has a long history of use as power sources such as soup or curry, and also used as ﬁber and a medicinal plant. Urtica dioica has traditionally been used in the control of cardiovascular disorders especially hypertension. The leaf extract of Urtica dioica has been reported to improve glucose homeostasis in vivo. Nettle root could prevent some of the effects of prostatic hyperplasia. Extracts of nettle leaf are used as anti-inﬂammatory remedies for rheumatoid arthritis. Urtica dioica extract signiﬁcantly increased the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel. This article aims to review the very wide ranging of pharmacological effects of Urtica dioica extract.
Methods: Articles on PuBmed between 1980 and 2019.
Results: Description and critical review of the pharmacological effects of Urtica dioica and other uses.
Conclusion: The nettle is actually a plant with many qualities and uses. The interest in it is deserved and it is given by other studies and investigations.},

Qualitative and quantitative liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analyses indicated that phenolic acids (5-O-caffeoylquinic acid as dominant) and flavonol glycosides (rutin, isoquercitrin, and kaempferol 3-O-glucoside) are present in the aerial parts, while lignans (secoisolariciresinol, 9,9'-bisacetyl-neo-olivil and their glucosides) were detected in the root. Herb and root extracts expressed selective inhibition toward cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase branches in human platelets: root extracts were better at inhibiting thromboxane production, while herb extracts were more specific toward inhibition of 12-lipoxygenase pathway. Stinging nettle extracts mildly increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and growth-related oncogene release from nonstimulated intestinal epithelial cells, stimulating MyD88/NF-κB/p38 signaling, hence preserving the epithelial integrity and enhancing intestinal steady-state defense. Additionally, root extract reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1/growth-related oncogene secretion and cyclooxygenase-2 expression in intestinal epithelial cells, thus showing the potential protective effect against tissue damage caused by inflammation processes. These observations suggest that stinging nettle is an interesting candidate for the development of phytopharmaceuticals or dietary supplements for cotreatment of various inflammatory diseases, particularly inflammatory bowel diseases.

	abstract = {Background: Urtica dioica, Taraxacum officinale, Calea integrifolia and Caesalpinia pulcherrima are widely used all over the world for treatment of different illnesses. In Mexico, these plants are traditionally used to alleviate or counteract rheumatism and inflammatory muscle diseases. In the present study we evaluated the activity of aqueous and methanolic extracts of these four plants, on the replication of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2).
Methods: Extraction process was carried out in a Soxtherm® system at 60, 85 and 120 °C; a chemical fractionation in silica gel chromatography was performed and compounds present in the active fractions were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MSn. The cytotoxic concentration and the inhibitory effect of extracts or fractions on the DENV2 replication were analyzed in the BHK-21 cell line (plaque forming assay). The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and the selectivity index (SI) were calculated for the extracts and fractions.
Results: The methanolic extracts at 60 °C of T. officinale and U. dioica showed the higher inhibitory effects on DENV2 replication. After the chemical fractionation, the higher activity fraction was found for U. dioica and T. officinale, presenting IC50 values of 165.7 ± 3.85 and 126.1 ± 2.80 μg/ml, respectively; SI values were 5.59 and 6.01 for each fraction. The compounds present in T. officinale, were luteolin and caffeoylquinic acids derivatives and quercertin diclycosides. The compounds in the active fraction of U. dioica, were, chlorogenic acid, quercertin derivatives and flavonol glycosides (quercetin and kaempferol).
Conclusions: Two fractions from U. dioica and T. officinale methanolic extracts with anti-dengue activity were found. The compounds present in both fractions were identified, several recognized molecules have demonstrated activity against other viral species. Subsequent biological analysis of the molecules, alone or in combination, contained in the extracts will be carried out to develop therapeutics against DENV2.},

Purpose: This study investigates the antioxidant capacity and the most abundant phenolic compounds of Urtica dioica L. leaf extract (UE), and its antihypertensive and antioxidative eﬀects in vivo. Study design: Spontaneously hypertensive rats were supplemented with 10, 50, and 200 mg/kg/day of UE and 10 mg/kg/day of losartan during 4-week period.
Methods: In this study, HPLC analysis of UE was performed, as well as the determination of antioxidant capacity, superoxide radical scavenging activity, and metal chelating ability. Hemodynamic parameters were measured directly in anesthetized rats. Also, antioxidant enzyme activity and concentration in erythrocytes were determined, as well as systemic oxidative stress and plasma antioxidant status.
Results: UE showed higher ferric reducing antioxidant power and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity than BHT, but lower than vitamin C. Furthermore, UE showed good metal chelating ability, but weak superoxide radical scavenging activity. All three tested UE doses managed to reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as cardiac index, and to improve the antioxidative defense by increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase, without changing the concentration of the enzymes. Moreover, UE supplementation increased plasma antioxidant capacity and reduced systemic oxidative stress.
Conclusion: Chronic UE dietary supplementation had beneﬁcial eﬀects in the experimental model of essential hypertension.},

	abstract = {The genus Urtica belongs to the family Urticaceae. The plants of this genus are known as nettles or, quite often, as stinging nettles. These plants can be easily identified by the presence of stinging hairs. Urtica species have previously been used for various medicinal purposes. The history for the use of these plants for medicinal purposes starts from the Bronze Age (3000-2000 BC). Medicinally, the genus Urtica has been used to treat several disorders, such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, bronchitis, diarrhea, sprains, kidney stones, urinary tract infection, high blood pressure, hemorrhoids, flu, cough, fever, and ulcers. Scientific reports on the phytochemical analysis of this genus has so far revealed more than 123 compounds from this genus, including terpenoids, flavonoids, lignans, sterols, and polyphenols, have been isolated. Various biological activities have been exhibited by these compounds, such as antihypertensive, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, antiurolithiatic, anthelmintic, diuretic, antinoceceptive, antidiabetic, antiviral, , and immunomodulatory. In this article, we mainly emphasize the phytochemical composition, therapeutic applications, and ethnopharmacological values of various species of genus Urtica.},

U. dioica leaf extracts were evaluated for their antibacterial and antioxidant effects as well as their flavonoid and polyphenol content. The hydroethanolic extract (EtOH-H2OE), showing the most potent antibacterial and antioxidant activities in vitro, thanks to its flavonoid and polyphenol richness, was selected for hemostatic and wound healing evaluation. Twenty-four rats completing full-thickness wounds were split into four groups. The wounds were topically treated with saline solution, glycerol, "CICAFLORA," and U. dioica EtOH-H2OE (50 µL/mm2) until day 11. The wound healing effect was assessed by macroscopic, histological, and biochemical parameters. Rats treated with EtOH-H2OE showed fast wound closure (92.39\%) compared to the control animals (60.91\%) on the 11th day of wounding (P {\textless} 0.01). Histopathological and biochemical explorations showed full epidermal regeneration and an improvement of the hydroxyproline content in the U. dioica EtOH-H2OE treated rats. Analysis of fatty acids and sterols by GC-MS showed the presence of unsaturated fatty acids and a high concentration of lupeol known for their involvement in reepithelialization. These results prove the efficiency of U. dioica EtOH-H2OE in wound healing and supported its traditional use.},

	abstract = {Nettles (genus Urtica, family Urticaceae) are of considerable interest as preservatives in foods for both human and animal consumption. They have also been used for centuries in traditional medicine. This paper reviews the properties of nettles that make them suitable for wider applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Nettles contain a significant number of biologically-active compounds. For example, the leaves are rich sources of terpenoids, carotenoids and fatty acids, as well as of various essential amino acids, chlorophyll, vitamins, tannins, carbohydrates, sterols, polysaccharides, isolectins and minerals. Extracts from the aerial parts of nettles are rich sources of polyphenols, while the roots contain oleanol acid, sterols and steryl glycosides. Due to the variety of phytochemicals and their proportions they contain, nettles show noticeable activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These properties make nettles suitable for a range of possible applications, including functional food, dietary supplements and pharmacological formulations. Despite these benefits, the nettle is still an underestimated plant source. This paper provides a unique overview of the latest research on nettle plants focusing on the possibilities for transforming a common weed into a commercial plant with a wide range of applications. Special attention is paid to the antimicrobial activity of the active compounds in nettles and to possible uses of these valuable plants in food and feed formulations.},

	abstract = {The gene encoding the precursor to stinging nettle (Urtica dioica L.) isolectin I was introduced into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). In transgenic plants this precursor was processed to mature-sized lectin. The mature isolectin is deposited intracellularly, most likely in the vacuoles. A gene construct lacking the C-terminal 25 amino acids was also introduced in tobacco to study the role of the C terminus in subcellular trafficking. In tobacco plants that expressed this construct, the mutant precursor was correctly processed and the mature isolectin was targeted to the intercellular space. These results indicate the presence of a C-terminal signal for intracellular retention of stinging nettle lectin and most likely for sorting of the lectin to the vacuoles. In addition, correct processing of this lectin did not depend on vacuolar deposition. Isolectin I purified from tobacco displayed identical biological activities as isolectin I isolated from stinging nettle. In vitro antifungal assays on germinated spores of the fungi Botrytis cinerea, Trichoderma viride, and Colletotrichum lindemuthianum revealed that growth inhibition by stinging nettle isolectin I occurs at a specific phase of fungal growth and is temporal, suggesting that the fungi had an adaptation mechanism.},

WEN had powerful antioxidant activity. The 50, 100 and 250 ␮g amounts of WEN showed 39, 66 and 98\% inhibition on peroxidation of linoleic acid emulsion, respectively, while 60 ␮g/ml of ␣-tocopherol, exhibited only 30\% inhibition. Moreover, WEN had effective reducing power, free radical scavenging, superoxide anion radical scavenging, hydrogen peroxide scavenging, and metal chelating activities at the same concentrations. Those various antioxidant activities were compared to standard antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), quercetin, and ␣-tocopherol. In addition, total phenolic compounds in the WEN were determined as pyrocatechol equivalent. WEN also showed antimicrobial activity against nine microorganisms, antiulcer activity against ethanol-induced ulcerogenesis and analgesic effect on acetic acid-induced stretching. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Methods: The in vitro antifungal activity of the extracts was measured by disc diffusion method and assessment of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The dorsum of the guinea pigs was infected with M. canis and topically treated as follows: negative control (NC) received no treatment; positive control (PC) received terbinafine 1 \%; DMSO group (negative control) received 10 \% DMSO (vehicle); while three other groups, viz, SN10\%, SN20\% and SN30\% received 10, 20 and 30 \% hydroalcohol extract dissolved in 10 \% DMSO, respectively. Results: Both extracts did not show considerable antifungal activity against M. canis compared with terbinafine. The MICs of aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts were 30 and 20 mg.ml-1, respectively. PC and SN30\% groups showed normal hair growth on day 15 while their skin looked healthy on day 30 post-inoculation. Lesion severity and clinical scores declined in SN30\% and PC groups in comparison to NC group, on day 30 post-inoculation. Also, on day 30 post-inoculation, the clinical efficacy of the test formulations increased to 11.76, 23.52, 76.47, 5.88, and 94.11 \% for SN10\%, SN20\%, SN30\%, DMSO10\%, and PC groups, respectively. Conclusions: The hydroalcoholic extract of this plant could be further developed, with a view to its possibe use as an adjunct remedy for topical treatment of tinea corporis. © Pharmacotherapy Group, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin City, 300001 Nigeria.

	abstract = {Abstract 1. The ameliorative potential and antioxidant capacity of an extract of Urtica dioica seeds
(UDS) was investigated using histopathological changes in liver and kidney, measuring serum marker
enzymes, antioxidant defence systems and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde (MDA)) content in
various tissues of broilers exposed to aflatoxin (AF).
2. A total of 32 broilers were divided randomly into 4 groups: control, UDS extract-treated, AF-treated
and AF+UDS extract-treated. Broilers in control and UDS extract-treated groups were fed on a diet
without AF. The AF-treated group and AF+UDS extract-treated groups were treated with an estimated
1 mg total AF/kg feed. The AF+UDS extract groups received in addition 30 ml UDS extract/kg diet for 21
d.
3. The AF-treated group had significantly decreased body weight gain when compared to the other
groups.
4. Biochemical analysis showed a small increase in the concentrations of serum aspartate aminotransferase,
alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase and lactate dehydrogenase in the AFtreated
group compared to that of the control group, whereas concentrations of these enzymes were
decreased in the AF+UDS group compared to that of the AF-treated group.
5. Administration of supplementary UDS extract helped restore the AF-induced increase in MDA and
reduced the antioxidant system towards normality, particularly in the liver, brain, kidney and heart.
Hepatorenal protection by UDS extracts was further supported by the almost normal histology in AF
+UDS extract-treated group as compared to the degenerative changes in the AF-treated broilers.
6. It was concluded that UDS extract has a protective hepatorenal effect in broilers affected by aflatoxicosis,
probably acting by promoting the antioxidative defence systems.},

The aim of this work was to evaluate a possible direct cardiovascular action of the plant and to investigate its mechanism of action. In aortic preparations with intact and functional endothelial layer, pre-contracted with KCl 20 mM or norepinephrine 3 mM, the crude aqueous and methanolic extracts of the plant roots, as well as purified fractions elicited a vasodilator action. Nevertheless, the vasodilator activity was not present in aortic rings without endothelial layer. In aortic rings with intact endothelial layer, the vasorelaxing effect was abolished by L-NAME, a NO-biosynthesis inhibitor, and ODQ, a guanylate cyclase inhibitor. Furthermore, potassium channel blockers (TEA, 4-aminopyridine, quinine, but not glybenclamide) antagonized the vasodilator action of the purified fraction F1W of U. dioica . The same fraction produced a marked decrease of inotropic activity, in spontanoeusly beating atria of guinea-pig, and a marked, but transient, hypotensive activity on the blood pressure of anaesthetized rats. It is concluded that U. dioica can produce hypotensive responses, through a vasorelaxing effect mediated by the release of endothelial nitric oxide and the opening of potassium channels, and through a negative inotropic action. \# 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

	abstract = {This study was performed on anaesthetized male Wistar rats that received a continuous intravenous perfusion during 1.25 h of an aqueous extract of aerial parts of Urtica dioica L. (Urticaceae) at a low dose of 4 mg/kg/h or at a high dose of 24 mg/kg/h, or furosemide (control diuretic) at a dose of 2 mg/kg/h. As compared with a control period in each rat, the arterial blood pressure was reduced proportionally to the dose of the perfusion of the plant extract (15 and 38\%, PB0.001, respectively). These effects were accompanied by a correlative increase of diuresis (11 and 84\%, P B0.001, respectively) and natriuresis (28 and 143\%, PB 0.001, respectively). In the rats perfused by furosemide, the arterial blood pressure was reduced by 28\% (PB 0.001). The diuresis and natriuresis were also increased proportionally in this case (85 and 155\%, PB0.001, respectively). Nevertheless, the hypotensive action of U. dioica was reversible during the recovery periods in about 1 h with the lower dose of the plant extract and furosemide, while the effect of the higher dose was persistent, indicating a possible toxic effect. In conclusion, the results demonstrate an acute hypotensive action of U. dioica that indicates a direct effect on the cardiovascular system. Moreover, diuretic and natriuretic effects were also observed, suggesting an action on the renal function. Finally, the plant extract seems to have a toxic effect at the higher dose. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) classification of the orders and families of angiosperms is presented. Several new orders are recognized: Boraginales, Dilleniales, Icacinales, Metteniusiales and Vahliales. This brings the total number of orders and families recognized in the APG system to 64 and 416, respectively. We propose two additional informal major clades, superrosids and superasterids, that each comprise the additional orders that are included in the larger clades dominated by the rosids and asterids. Families that made up potentially monofamilial orders, Dasypogonaceae and Sabiaceae, are instead referred to Arecales and Proteales, respectively. Two parasitic families formerly of uncertain positions are now placed: Cynomoriaceae in Saxifragales and Apodanthaceae in Cucurbitales. Although there is evidence that some families recognized in APG III are not monophyletic, we make no changes in Dioscoreales and Santalales relative to APG III and leave some genera in Lamiales unplaced (e.g. Peltanthera). These changes in familial circumscription and recognition have all resulted from new results published since APG III, except for some changes simply due to nomenclatural issues, which include substituting Asphodelaceae for Xanthorrhoeaceae (Asparagales) and Francoaceae for Melianthaceae (Geraniales); however, in Francoaceae we also include Bersamaceae, Ledocarpaceae, Rhynchothecaceae and Vivianiaceae. Other changes to family limits are not drastic or numerous and are mostly focused on some members of the lamiids, especially the former Icacinaceae that have long been problematic with several genera moved to the formerly monogeneric Metteniusaceae, but minor changes in circumscription include Aristolochiaceae (now including Lactoridaceae and Hydnoraceae; Aristolochiales), Maundiaceae (removed from Juncaginaceae; Alismatales), Restionaceae (now re-including Anarthriaceae and Centrolepidaceae; Poales), Buxaceae (now including Haptanthaceae; Buxales), Peraceae (split from Euphorbiaceae; Malpighiales), recognition of Petenaeaceae (Huerteales), Kewaceae, Limeaceae, Macarthuriaceae and Microteaceae (all Caryophyllales), Petiveriaceae split from Phytolaccaceae (Caryophyllales), changes to the generic composition of Ixonanthaceae and Irvingiaceae (with transfer of Allantospermum from the former to the latter; Malpighiales), transfer of Pakaraimaea (formerly Dipterocarpaceae) to Cistaceae (Malvales), transfer of Borthwickia, Forchhammeria, Stixis and Tirania (formerly all Capparaceae) to Resedaceae (Brassicales), Nyssaceae split from Cornaceae (Cornales), Pteleocarpa moved to Gelsemiaceae (Gentianales), changes to the generic composition of Gesneriaceae (Sanango moved from Loganiaceae) and Orobanchaceae (now including Lindenbergiaceae and Rehmanniaceae) and recognition of Mazaceae distinct from Phrymaceae (all Lamiales).},

	abstract = {L'hypertrophie bénigne de la prostate est reconnue comme étant l'une des maladies les plus fréquentes chez l'homme de plus de 70 ans. Initialement, les symptômes irritatifs urinaires sont les mictions nocturnes fréquentes, l'envie impérieuse d'urine, un jet d'urine faible
De nos jours, il existe de nombreuses approches thérapeutiques pour neutraliser ces troubles mictionnels. La chirurgie reste sans aucun doute le traitement le plus efficace, mais elle est souvent considérée comme une atteunte à la virilité. Certains médicalements antiprostatiques, quant à eux, entraînent des effets indésirables non négligeables.
C'est pourquoi la phytothérapie a pris de l'importance dans ce domaine, notamment avec les extraits de fruits du Palmier nain (PERMIXON*), les extraits d'écorces du Prunier d'Afrique (TADENAN*) et depuis quelques années les extraits de racines d'Ortie dioïque.
Ces extraits d'Ortie agissent à différents niveaux : ils réduisent le taux d'oestrogènes, possèdent une activité anti-inflammatoire, inhibent la prolifération cellulaire en réduisant l'action des facteurs de croissance en inhibant l'enzyme Na+, K+ ATPase et en diminuant l'action de la dihydrotestostérone au niveau des cellules prostatiques.
L'administration orale d'extraits de racines d'Ortie améliore les désordres mictionnels associés à l'hypertrophie bénigne de la prostate avec une tolérance bonne voire très bonne. Son efficacité est cependant limitée aux stades primaires de l'adénome prostatique avec un traitement de longue durée pour les cas les plus sévères.
L'Ortie s'est montré un médicament prostatrope adapté qui a la possibilité d'améliorer la qualité de vie des patients atteints d'hypertrophie bénigne de la prostate.},

So far, global agricultural development has focused on increased productivity rather than on a holistic natural resource management for food security. Thus, developing more sustainable farming practices on a large scale is of utmost importance. However, information concerning the performance of farming systems under organic and conventional management in tropical and subtropical regions is scarce. This study presents agronomic and economic data from the conversion phase (2007–2010) of a farming systems comparison trial on a Vertisol soil in Madhya Pradesh, central India. A cotton-soybean-wheat crop rotation under biodynamic, organic and conventional (with and without Bt cotton) management was investigated. We observed a significant yield gap between organic and conventional farming systems in the 1st crop cycle (cycle 1: 2007–2008) for cotton (−29\%) and wheat (−27\%), whereas in the 2nd crop cycle (cycle 2: 2009–2010) cotton and wheat yields were similar in all farming systems due to lower yields in the conventional systems. In contrast, organic soybean (a nitrogen fixing leguminous plant) yields were marginally lower than conventional yields (−1\% in cycle 1, −11\% in cycle 2). Averaged across all crops, conventional farming systems achieved significantly higher gross margins in cycle 1 (+29\%), whereas in cycle 2 gross margins in organic farming systems were significantly higher (+25\%) due to lower variable production costs but similar yields. Soybean gross margin was significantly higher in the organic system (+11\%) across the four harvest years compared to the conventional systems. Our results suggest that organic soybean production is a viable option for smallholder farmers under the prevailing semi-arid conditions in India. Future research needs to elucidate the long-term productivity and profitability, particularly of cotton and wheat, and the ecological impact of the different farming systems.},

Soil under integrated management had a significantly reduced bacterial species richness compared to organic, but community composition was similar to organically and biodynamically managed soils. Highest fungal richness was obtained under cover crop between rows in topsoil, arising from cover cropping and organic carbon supply.},

	abstract = {The main objective of this study was to determine growth, yield and fruit quality of grapevines under organic and biodynamic management in relation to integrated viticultural practices. Furthermore, the mechanisms for the observed changes in growth, yield and fruit quality were investigated by determining nutrient status, physiological performance of the plants and disease incidence on bunches in three consecutive growing seasons. A field trial (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Riesling) was set up at Hochschule Geisenheim University, Germany. The integrated treatment was managed according to the code of good practice. Organic and biodynamic plots were managed according to Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 and Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 and according to ECOVIN- and Demeter-Standards, respectively. The growth and yield of the grapevines differed strongly among the different management systems, whereas fruit quality was not affected by the management system. The organic and the biodynamic treatments showed significantly lower growth and yield in comparison to the integrated treatment. The physiological performance was significantly lower in the organic and the biodynamic systems, which may account for differences in growth and cluster weight and might therefore induce lower yields of the respective treatments. Soil management and fertilization strategy could be responsible factors for these changes. Yields of the organic and the biodynamic treatments partially decreased due to higher disease incidence of downy mildew. The organic and the biodynamic plant protection strategies that exclude the use of synthetic fungicides are likely to induce higher disease incidence and might partially account for differences in the nutrient status of vines under organic and biodynamic management. Use of the biodynamic preparations had little influence on vine growth and yield. Due to the investigation of important parameters that induce changes especially in growth and yield of grapevines under organic and biodynamic management the study can potentially provide guidance for defining more effective farming systems.},

The results show that plants are able to germinate and grow on both Martian and moon soil simulant for a period of 50 days without any addition of nutrients. Growth and flowering on Mars regolith simulant was much better than on moon regolith simulant and even slightly better than on our control nutrient poor river soil. Reflexed stonecrop (a wild plant); the crops tomato, wheat, and cress; and the green manure species field mustard performed particularly well. The latter three flowered, and cress and field mustard also produced seeds. Our results show that in principle it is possible to grow crops and other plant species in Martian and Lunar soil simulants. However, many questions remain about the simulants' water carrying capacity and other physical characteristics and also whether the simulants are representative of the real soils.},

Vine managements systems are further challenged by climatic changes. Of the 8 million hectares grown worldwide, conventional and organic practices cover 90\% and 9\% of acreage, respectively. Biodynamic cultivation accounts for 1\%. Although economic success combined with low environmental impact is widely claimed by biodynamic winegrowers from California, to South Africa, and France, this practice is still controversial in viticulture and scientific communities. To rethink the situation, we encouraged stakeholders to confront conventional and biodynamic paradigms in a Participative-Action-Research. Co-designed questions were followed up by holistic comparison of conventional and biodynamic vineyard managements. Here we show that the amplitude of plant responses to climatic threats was higher in biodynamic than conventional management. The same stood true for seasonal trends and pathogens attacks. This was associated with higher expression of silencing and immunity genes, and higher anti-oxidative and anti-fungal secondary metabolite levels. This suggests that sustainability of biodynamic practices probably relies on fine molecular regulations. Such knowledge should contribute to resolving disagreements between stakeholders and help designing the awaited sustainable viticulture at large.},

	abstract = {Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer and the ineffectiveness of the current therapies seriously limits the survival rate of NSCLC patients. In the search for new antitumor agents, nature has played a pivotal role providing a variety of molecules, which are likely to exert selective anti-tumour properties. Herein, we investigated the antiproliferative potential of Urtica dioica L. extract (UD) against NSCLC cell models with low sensitivity to cisplatin, a cytotoxic agent largely employed to cure NSCLCs. UD inhibited cell proliferation in the selected cells, while no toxic effects were observed in normal lung cells. Furthermore, the co-treatment of UD and cisplatin notably sensitised NSCLC cells to cisplatin. Mechanistically, we discovered that UD-promoted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress via activation of the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153) triggering apoptosis. We also performed an extensive NMR analysis of UD, identifying rutin and oxylipins as the main secondary metabolites present in the mixture. Additionally, we discovered that an oxylipins’ enriched fraction contributes to the antiproliferative activity of the plant extract. In the future, this study may provide new chemical scaffolds for the design of anti-cancer agents that target NSCLCs with low sensitivity to cisplatinum.},

	abstract = {Parietaria diffusa M. et K., Urtica dioica L. (Urticaceae) and Sambucus nigra L. (Caprifoliaceae) are plants usually used in popular medicine of central Italy for treating numerous diseases, ﬁrst of all Herpes zoster. Several plant products have been described as potential antiviral agents, with special attention being devoted to those having retroviruses as etiological agents, including acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome (AIDS), in which a retrovirus, the designated human immunodeﬁciency virus HIV, has been clearly identiﬁed as the primary cause of this disease. The present study proposes a preliminary screening of the antiviral activity of Parietaria diffusa, Sambucus nigra and Urtica dioica preparation against the feline immunodeﬁciency virus (FIV) infection. The feline immunodeﬁciency virus is a widespread lentivirus of domestic cats sharing numerous biological and pathogenic features with the human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV). FIV infection in cats has therefore been proposed as an animal model for AIDS studies with respect to pathogenesis, chemotherapy, and vaccine development [Pedersen, N.C., 1993.

The tenofovir/CBA combinations predominantly showed synergistic antiviral activity using the median effect principle.

Here we demonstrated that the N-acetylglucosamine-binding protein from Urtica dioica (UDA) prevents HIV entry and eventually selects for viruses in which conserved N-glycosylation sites in GP120 were deleted. In contrast to the mannose-binding proteins, which have a 50-100-fold decreased antiviral activity against the UDA-exposed mutant viruses, UDA has decreased anti-HIV activity to a very limited extent, even against those mutant virus strains that lack at least 9 of 22 (∼40\%) glycosylation sites in their GP120 envelope. Therefore, UDA represents the prototype of a new conceptual class of carbohydrate-binding agents with an unusually specific and targeted drug resistance profile. It forces HIV to escape drug pressure by deleting the indispensable glycans on its GP120, thereby obligatorily exposing previously hidden immunogenic epitopes on its envelope.},

With the exception of herpes simplex virus, AB is inactive against a broad variety of other (DNA and RNA) viruses. Time-of-addition studies show that AB prevents HIV-1 infection at the virus entry stage, exactly at the same time as carbohydrate-binding agents do. AB also efficiently prevents fusion between persistently HIV-1-infected HUT-78 cells and uninfected (CD4+) lymphocytes, DC-SIGN-directed HIV-1 capture, and subsequent transmission to uninfected (CD4+) T lymphocytes. Prolonged passaging of HIV-1 at dose-escalating concentrations of AB resulted in the selection of mutant virus strains in which several N-glycans of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope were deleted and in which positively charged amino acid mutations in both gp120 and gp41 appeared. A mutant virus strain in which four N-glycans were deleted showed a 10-fold decrease in sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of AB. These data suggest that AB is likely endowed with carbohydrate-binding properties and can be considered an important lead compound in the development of novel synthetic nonpeptidic antiviral drugs targeting the glycans of the envelope of HIV.},

	abstract = {Objective:
Effects of cotreatment with Urtica dioica (UD) methanolic leaf extract on gentamicin (GM)-induced acute kidney injury were evaluated in rats.

Materials and Methods:
Male Wistar rats (n=32) were separated into four groups. Gentamicin (100 mg/kg/day, IP) was injected for eight days with or without UD methanolic extract (200 mg/kg/day, gavage).  The renal blood flow (RBF) and systolic blood pressure of rats were recorded. Concentration of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sodium, and potassium and osmolarity were measured in the urine and plasma samples. Oxidative stress level was determined by assessment of the levels of antioxidant power (FRAP) and lipid peroxidation (MDA) in the renal tissue. The renal injury and histopathological changes in the kidney were determined by microscopic evaluations.

Results:
Administration of UD extract along with GM, compared to GM group, significantly decreased the amounts of plasma creatinine and BUN, urinary sodium excretion, fractional excretion of sodium and potassium, and MDA levels but significantly increased creatinine clearance, urine osmolarity, renal blood flow and FRAP levels. 

Conclusion:
The cotreatment of UD extract can attenuate renal injury of GM by reduction of oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and oxygen free radicals. The potential nephroprotective effects of UD extract are probably mediated via its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity.},

The results indicate that nettle has a significant antihyperglycemic effect in OGTT model. This effect may be caused in part by the reduction of intestinal glucose absorption.

Results: The extract dose-dependently reduced acetic acid-induced abdominal twitches. In formalin test, the extract at any of applied doses (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) could not suppress the licking behavior of first phase while doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg significantly inhibited the second phase of formalin test. In carrageenan test, the extract at a dose of 400 mg/kg significantly inhibited the paw edema by 26\%. ,

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES:
To evaluate the effects of Urtica dioica on hepatic ischemia‐reperfusion injury.

METHODS:
Thirty adult male Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups: sham group (group 1), control group (group 2), and Urtica dioica group (group 3). All the rats were exposed to hepatic ischemia for 60 min, followed by 60 min of reperfusion. In group 2, a total of 2 ml/kg 0.9\% saline solution was given intraperitoneally. In group 3, a total of 2 ml/kg Urtica dioica was given intraperitoneally. At the end of the procedure, liver tissue and blood samples were taken from all rats. Serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, ceruloplasmin, catalase, paraoxonase, arylesterase, and lipid hydroperoxide levels were measured. Liver tissue histopathologies were also evaluated by light microscopy.

RESULTS:
Serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase levels were significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1, and significantly lower in group 3 than in group 2. Also, group 2 had higher serum lipid hydroperoxides and ceruloplasmin levels but lower catalase, paraoxonase, and arylesterase levels than group 1., In group 3, serum lipid hydroperoxides and ceruloplasmin levels were significantly lower, and catalase, paraoxonase, and arylesterase levels were higher than those in group 2. Histopathological examination showed that liver tissue damage was significantly decreased in group 3 compared with group 2.

CONCLUSIONS:
Urtica dioica has a protective effect on the liver in hepatic ischemia‐reperfusion‐injured rats.},

	abstract = {Platelet hyperactivity plays an important role in arterial thrombosis and atherosclerosis. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of different extracts of Urtica dioica leaves on platelet aggregation. Rat platelets were prepared and incubated in vitro with different concentrations of the tested extracts and aggregation was induced by different agonists including thrombin (0.5 U/mL), ADP (10 µm), epinephrine (100 µm) and collagen (5 mg/mL). The crude aqueous extract inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. At 1 mg/mL, the percent inhibition was 17.1 ± 4.2\%. Soxhlet extraction of the plant leaves with different successive solvents showed that the ethyl acetate extract exhibited the most antiaggregant effect with an inhibition of 76.8 ± 6.1\% at 1 mg/mL. Flavonoids isolated from the plant leaves, produced a strong inhibitory effect on thrombin-induced platelet aggregation with an IC50 of 0.25 ± 0.05 and 0.40 ± 0.04 mg/mL for genins and heterosidic flavonoids, respectively. Flavonoids also markedly inhibited platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen and epinephrine. It is concluded that Urtica dioica has an antiplatelet action in which flavonoids are mainly implicated. These results support the traditional use of Urtica dioica in the treatment and/or prevention of cardiovascular disease. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We observed that mice administered with chronic dexamethasone resulted in hypercortisolemia, oxidative stress, depressive like behavior, cognitive impairment, hyperglycemia with reduced body weight, increased water intake and decreased hippocampal glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) mRNA expression. Urtica dioica significantly reduced hyperglycemia, plasma corticosterone, oxidative stress and depressive like behavior as well as improved associative memory and hippocampal GLUT4 mRNA expression comparable to rosiglitazone (5 mg/kg, p.o.). Further, Urtica dioica insignificantly improved spatial memory and serum insulin.

	abstract = {Several species of the genus Urtica (especially Urtica dioica, Urticaceae), are used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments. To better understand the chemical diversity of the genus and to compare different accessions and different taxa of Urtica, 63 leaf samples representing a broad geographical, taxonomical and morphological diversity were evaluated under controlled conditions. A molecular phylogeny for all taxa investigated was prepared to compare phytochemical similarity with phylogenetic relatedness. Metabolites were analyzed via UPLC–PDA–MS and multivariate data analyses. In total, 43 metabolites were identified, with phenolic compounds and hydroxy fatty acids as the dominant substance groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) provides a first structured chemotaxonomy of the genus. The molecular data present a highly resolved phylogeny with well-supported clades and subclades. U. dioica is retrieved as both para- and polyphyletic. European members of the U. dioica group and the North American subspecies share a rather similar metabolite profile and were largely retrieved as one, nearly exclusive cluster by metabolite data. This latter cluster also includes – remotely related – Urtica urens, which is pharmaceutically used in the same way as U. dioica. However, most highly supported phylogenetic clades were not retrieved in the metabolite cluster analyses. Overall, metabolite profiles indicate considerable phytochemical diversity in the genus, which largely falls into a group characterized by high contents of hydroxy fatty acids (e.g., most Andean-American taxa) and another group characterized by high contents of phenolic acids (especially the U. dioica-clade). Anti-inflammatory in vitro COX1 enzyme inhibition assays suggest that bioactivity may be predicted by gross metabolic profiling in Urtica.},

Plants and herbs may play an important role in complementary or alternative treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-proliferative potential of Urtica dioica. The anti oxidant activity of an aqueous extract of Urtica dioica leaf was measured by MTT assay and the FRAP method while its anti-proliferative activity on the human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and fibroblasts isolated from foreskin tissue was evaluated using MTT assay. Mechanisms leading to apoptosis were also investigated at the molecular level by measuring the amount of anti and pro-apoptotic proteins and at the cellular level by studying DNA fragmentation and annexin V staining by flow cytometry. The aqueous extract of Urtica dioica showed antioxidant effects with a correlation coefficient of r2=0.997. Dose-dependent and anti-proliferative effects of the extract were observed only on MCF-7 cells after 72 hrs with an IC50 value of 2 mg/ml. This anti proliferative activity was associated with an increase of apoptosis as demonstrated by DNA fragmentation, the appearance of apoptotic cells in flow cytometry analysis and an increase of the amount of calpain 1, calpastatin, caspase 3, caspase 9, Bax and Bcl-2, all proteins involved in the apoptotic pathway. This is the first time such in vitro antiproliferative effect of aqueous extract of Urtica dioica leaf has been described for a breast cancer cell line. Our findings warrant further research on Urtica dioica as a potential chemotherapeutic agent for breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Objective(s):
One strategy for the treatment of diabetes is inhibition of pancreatic α- amylase. Plants contains different chemical constituents with potential for inhibition of α-amylase and hence maybe used as therapeutic.

Materials and Methods:
Urtica dioica and Juglans regia Linn were tested for α-amylase inhibition. Different concentrations of leaf aqueous extracts were incubated with enzyme substrate solution and the activity of enzyme was measured. For determination of the type of inhibition, Dixon plot was depicted. Acarbose was used as the standard inhibitor.

Results:
Both plant extracts showed time and concentration dependent inhibition of α-amylase. 60\% inhibition was seen with 2 mg/ml of U. dioica and 0.4 mg/ml of J. regia aqueous extract. Dixon plots revealed the type of α-amylase inhibition by these two extracts as competitive inhibition.

Conclusion:
Determination of the type of α-amylase inhibition by these plant extracts could provide by successful use of plant chemicals as drug targets.},

	abstract = {Urtica Dioica (UD) is a plant shown to reduce blood glucose levels upon oral ingestion; however, neither its active component nor its mechanism of action has been identified. One active fraction of this extract, termed UD-1, was separated by molecular sieve column chromatography and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). While UD-1 did not stimulate insulin secretion in glucose-responsive MIN6 clonal beta-cells, chronic exposure (24 h) significantly enhanced glucose uptake (∼1.5-fold) in L6-GLUT4myc myoblast cells. Using HPLC and MALDI-TOF, we further purified the UD-1 fraction into two fractions termed UD-1A and UD-1B. Computational and structural analyses strongly suggested that the antidiabetic component of UD-1 was due to one or more structurally related cyclical peptides that facilitate glucose uptake by forming unique glucose permeable pores. The structure and function of these glucose-conducting pores are discussed herein. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Recently, there has also been other investigators that indicated the hypoglycemic effect of Urtica dioica. But so far, the mechanism of this effect has not been deduced. In this report, a perifusion system is arranged in which an exact number of Langerhans Islets were exposed to several fractions of extracts of Urtica dioica by TLC. The active ingredient fraction named F1, caused a marked increase in insulin secretion. A simultaneous assay of glucose showed that the increase in insulin level was associated with a decrease in glucose level. Furthermore, the active component of Urtica dioica was found to increase the insulin content of blood sera in normal and streptozotocin diabetic rats that were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with the active ingredient of the extract. The in vivo studies presented in this report show that not only an increase in insulin level of blood sera was observed in rats after 30min from the initial point of injection but a simultaneous decrease of blood sugar was detected when similar sera was tested for glucose. The increase in insulin level was six times during the 120min of our determination. The decrease in blood sugar was found to be similar both in the level and time of initiation. On the basis of our findings, we assume that F1 is the active ingredient of plant leaves extract. The results show that the blood lowering effect of the extract was due to the enhancement of insulin secretion by Langerhance Isletes.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Urtica dioica extract (UDE) treatment on cerulein induced acute pancreatitis in rats. Twenty-one Wistar Albino rats were divided into three groups: Control, Pancreatitis, and UDE treatment group. In the control group no procedures were performed. In the pancreatitis and treatment groups, pancreatitis was induced with intraperitoneal injection of cerulein, followed by intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml saline (pancreatitis group) and 1 ml 5.2\% UDE (treatment group). Pancreatic tissues were examined histopathologically. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α), amylase and markers of apoptosis (M30, M65) were also measured in blood samples. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with Caspase-3 antibody. Histopathological findings in the UDE treatment group were less severe than in the pancreatitis group (5.7 vs 11.7, p = 0.010). TNF-α levels were not statistically different between treated and control groups (63.3 vs. 57.2, p = 0.141). UDE treatment was associated with less apoptosis [determined by M30, caspase-3 index (\%)], (1.769 vs. 0.288, p = 0.056; 3\% vs. 2.2\%, p = 0.224; respectively).

	abstract = {Nettle seed gum (NSG) which is a novel potential source of hydrocolloid was characterized in terms of yield, physicochemical, rheological, functional and thermal properties. According to Response Surface Methodology, the maximum extraction yield was determined as 6.17\% on dry basis. In order to clarify the structural information of the gum, the FT-IR analysis and monosaccharide composition determination were performed. In the results, the NSG had 8.48\% moisture, 10.81\% total ash, 2.89\% total protein, 1.15\% total oil and 76.67\% total carbohydrate. The FT-IR analysis revealed the existence of carboxyl groups, which gives the gum the capability of ion binding. Furthermore, Mannose/Galactose ratio was calculated as 1.07, indicating the water solubility of gum. DSC analysis showed that the NSG was highly stable in thermal process. Intrinsic viscosity, average viscosity and molecular weight values were determined as 8.56 ± 0.4 dL/g and 1.89 ± 0.1 × 106 g/mol, respectively. The emulsification capacity, emulsion stability and foam formation capacity of the NSG were 48\%, 40\% and 4\%, respectively. The NSG exhibited shear thinning behavior while dynamic rheological analysis indicated the NSG had viscoelastic properties and G′ (the storage modulus) was higher than G″ (the loss modulus). In conclusion, the present study supplied novel knowledge on the NSG, which will be inestimable for clarifying its matchless functional properties.},

Urtica extract was administered by intraperitoneal injection to male Wistar rats at 200mgkg−1day−1 for 4 days from which were also co-administered with intraperitoneal injection of 50mg of MCkg−1 of body weight twice on days 1 and 3. MC treatment increased the 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity of the liver, lung, and kidney 54-, 21-, and 119-fold, respectively. Urtica treatment substantially reduced the 3MC induction of hepatic, lung, and renal EROD activity by 79, 42, and 50\%, respectively. Similarly, compared with the control, MROD activities in liver and kidney were increased after MC administration, and these increases were significantly inhibited by Urtica. reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis clearly showed that the hepatic CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNA levels substantially increased after treatment with MC, which was suppressed by Urtica supplementation. Western blotting studies also supported the alterations observed in the catalytic activities and mRNA levels. In conclusion, substantial reduction in CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 expression levels and related activities with Urtica are possibly associated with a potential chemoprotective ability of the Urtica due to the anticipated decrease in the activation of environmental chemical carcinogens through modulation of the CYP1A enzymes.},

One of the various prostate cancer therapy methods is hormone therapy, and explaining the association between androgen hormones and prostate cancer is a critical role for successful prostate cancer treatment.Materials and Methods: In the current study, the behavior of 3,4- divanillyltetrahydrofuran (DTH) was examined against prostate cancer cells, which have androgen sensitivity differences [LNCaP (+), PC3 (-)]. For this aim, DTH was obtained by extraction of Urtica dioica roots. The molecular structure of isolated compound was confirmed as DTH by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses. To evaluate the association of androgen sensitivity, DTH was radiolabeled with 131I, and cell uptake assay was performed by using 131I-radiolabeled DTH. Also, cytotoxicity (WST-1) assay of DTH was performed against LNCaP and PC3 cells to determinate the toxic effects of DTH on different androgen mechanisms.Results: The results of assays on cells have shown that DTH lignan behaves different like being more toxic to LNCaP cells than PC3 cells, depending on androgen sensitivity.Conclusion: The results may contribute both the research topics of phytolignan prostate cancer and androgen-sensitive prostate cancer.},

Sporadic Alzheimer’s Disease (SAD) is caused by genetic risk factors, aging and oxidative stresses. The herbal extract of Rosa canina (R. canina), Tanacetum vulgare (T. vulgare) and Urtica dioica (U. dioica) has a beneficial role in aging, as an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative agent. In this study, the neuroprotective effects of this herbal extract in the rat model of SAD was investigated.

Methods:
The rats were divided into control, sham, model, herbal extract -treated and ethanol-treated groups. Drug interventions were started on the 21st day after modeling and each treatment group was given the drugs by intraperitoneal (I.P.) route for 21 days. The expression levels of the five important genes for pathogenesis of SAD including Syp, Psen1, Mapk3, Map2 and Tnf-α were measured by qPCR between the hippocampi of SAD model which were treated by this herbal extract and control groups. The Morris Water Maze was adapted to test spatial learning and memory ability of the rats.

Results:
Treatment of the rat model of SAD with herbal extract induced a significant change in expression of Syp (p=0.001) and Psen1 (p=0.029). In Morris Water Maze, significant changes in spatial learning seen in the rat model group were improved in herbal-treated group.

Conclusion:
This herbal extract could have anti-dementia properties and improve spatial learning and memory in SAD rat model.},

Antioxidant activity of hydro alcoholic extract and its fractions petroleum ether fraction (PEF), ethyl acetate fraction (EAF), n-butanol fraction (NBF) and aqueous fraction (AF) were determined by DPPH and NO radicals scavenging assay. Fractions were subjected to in-vitro HepG2 cell line study. Further, the most potent fraction (EAF) was subjected to in-vivo hepatoprotective potential against CCl4 challenged rats. The in-vivo hepatoprotective active fraction was chromatographed on silica column to isolate the bioactive constituent(s). Structure elucidation was done by using various spectrophotometric techniques like UV, IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MS spectroscopy. Ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) of hydro-alcoholic extract of U. dioica possessed the potent antioxidant activity viz. DPPH (IC50 78.99 ± 0.17 μg/ml) and NO (IC50101.39 ± 0.30 μg/ml). The in-vitro HepG2 cell line study showed that the EAF prevented the cell damage. The EAF significantly attenuated the increased liver enzymes activities in serum and oxidative parameters in tissue of CCl4-induced rats, suggesting hepatoprotective and anti-oxidant action respectively. Column chromatography of most potent antioxidant fraction (EAF) lead to the isolation of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy cinnamic acid (ferulic acid) which is responsible for its hepatoprotective potential. Hence, the present study suggests that EAF of hydro-alcoholic extract has significant antioxidant and hepatoprotective potential on CCl4 induced hepatotoxicity in-vitro and in-vivo.},

In many cultures, nettle is also eaten as a leafy vegetable. In this study, we focused on nettle yield (edible portion) and processing effects on nutritive and dietary properties. Actively growing shoots were harvested from field plots and leaves separated from stems. Leaf portions (200 g) were washed and processed by blanching (1 min at 96–98°C) or cooking (7 min at 98-99°C) with or without salt (5 g·L−1). Samples were cooled immediately after cooking and kept in frozen storage before analysis. Proximate composition, mineral, amino acid, and vitamin contents were determined, and nutritive value was estimated based on 100 g serving portions in a 2000 calorie diet. Results show that processed nettle can supply 90\%–100\% of vitamin A (including vitamin A as β-carotene) and is a good source of dietary calcium, iron, and protein. We recommend fresh or processed nettle as a high-protein, low-calorie source of essential nutrients, minerals, and vitamins particularly in vegetarian, diabetic, or other specialized diets.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the effects of therapy with Urtica dioica for symptomatic relief of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, partial crossover, comparative trial of Urtica dioica with placebo in 620 patients was conducted. Patients were evaluated using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), the maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), postvoid residual urine volume (PVR), Serum Prostatic- Specific Antigen (PSA), testosterone levels, and prostate size. At the end of 6-month trial, unblinding revealed that patients who initially received the placebo were switched to Urtica dioica. Both groups continued the medication up to 18 months.
RESULTS: 558 patients (90\%) completed the study (287/305, 91\% in the Urtica dioica group, and 271/315, 86\% in the placebo group). By intention- to-treat analysis, at the end of 6-month trial, 232 (81\%) of 287 patients in the Urtica dioica group reported improved LUTS compared with 43 (16\%) of 271 patients in the placebo group (P {\textless} 0.001). Both IPSS and Qmax showed greater improvement with drug than with placebo. The IPSS went from 19.8 down to 11.8 with Urtica dioica and from 19.2 to 17.7 with placebo (P = 0.002). Peak flow rates improved by 3.4 mL/s for placebo recipients and by 8.2 mL/s for treated patients (P {\textless} 0.05). In Urtica dioica group, PVR decreased from an initial value of 73 to 36 mL (P {\textless} 0.05). No appreciable change was seen in the placebo group. Serum PSA and testosterone levels were unchanged in both groups. A modest decrease in prostate size as measured by transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) was seen in Urtica dioica group (from 40.1 cc initially to 36.3 cc; P {\textless} 0.001). There was no change in the prostate volume at the end of study with placebo. At 18-month follow-up, only patients who continued therapy, had a favorable treatment variables value. No side effects were identified in either group.
CONCLUSION: In the present study, Urtica dioica have beneficial effects in the treatment of symptomatic BPH. Further clinical trials should be conducted to confirm these results before concluding that Urtica dioica is effective.},

The aim of this work was to evaluate the bioaccessibility (BAC), the bioavailability (BAV) and the antioxidant activity of nettle phenolic compounds present in foods and supplements. The BAC of nettle phenolics was evaluated with an in vitro dynamic digestion of real food matrices: the type of food matrix and chemical characteristic affected the kinetics of release and solubilization, with the highest BAC after duodenal digestion. A study of duodenal trans epithelial transport evidenced low bioavailability of native forms of 3-CQA, CMA and rutin. Simulation of colonic metabolism confirmed that phenolic compounds are fermented by gut microflora, confirming the need for further investigations on the impact of phenolic compounds at the large intestine level. Photochemiluminescence assay of the simulated digestion fluids demonstrated that ingestion of Urtica based foods contributes to create an antioxidant environment against superoxide anion radicals in the entire gastrointestinal tract (GIT).},

The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of dried Urtica dioica leaf alcoholic and aqueous extracts on the number and the diameter of the islets and histological parameters in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats. Six rats were used in each group. Group I: Normal rats were administered saline daily for 8 weeks. Group II: Diabetic rats were administered streptozotocin, 50 mg/kg of body weight; Group III: Diabetic rats were administered dried Urtica dioica leaf aqueous extracts for 8 weeks; Group IV: Diabetic rats were administered dried Urtica dioica leaf alcoholic extracts for 8 weeks. The animals, groups of diabetic and normal, were sacrificed by ether anaesthesia. Whole pancreas was dissected. The tissue samples were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded for microscopic examination. Histologic examination and grading were carried out on hematoxylin-eosin stained sections. The effects of administration of dried Urtica dioica leaf alcoholic and aqueous extracts to diabetic rats were determined by histopathologic examination. The pancreas from control rats showed normal pancreatic islets histoarchitecture. Our results also, indicate that the pancreas from diabetic rats show injury of pancreas tissue while the pancreas from diabetic rats treated with dried Urtica dioica leaf alcoholic and aqueous extracts show slight to moderate rearrangement of islets. According to our findings, dried Urtica dioica leaf alcoholic and aqueous extracts can cause a suitable repair of pancreatic tissue in streptozocin-induced diabetic experimental model.},

We investigated the effects of UT on obesity- induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Male C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups: low-fat diet (LFD), high-fat diet (HFD) and HFD supplemented with UT. Body weight, body composition, plasma glucose and plasma insulin were monitored. Skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) was analyzed for insulin sensitivity, ceramide accumulation and the post translational modification and activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). PP2A is activated by ceramides and dephosphorylates Akt. C2C12 myotubes exposed to excess free fatty acids with or without UT were also evaluated for insulin signaling and modulation of PP2A. The HFD induced insulin resistance, increased fasting plasma glucose, enhanced ceramide accumulation and PP2A activity in skeletal muscle. Supplementation with UT improved plasma glucose homeostasis and enhanced skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity without affecting body weight and body composition. In myotubes, UT attenuated the ability of FFAs to induce insulin resistance and PP2A hyperactivity without affecting ceramide accumulation and PP2A expression. UT decreased PP2A activity through posttranslational modification that was accompanied by a reduction in Akt dephosphorylation.},

The present study was designed to study anxiolytic property of methanolic extracts of Urtica urens; an important and commonly used for its medicinal properties belongs to urticaceae family.

Methods
The anxiolytic activity was evaluated with the adult mice by hole board test, and the light–dark box test, and motor coordination with the rota rod test. The efficacy of the plant extract (100–400 mg/kg) was compared with the standard anxiolytic drug diazepam (1 mg/kg i.p.)

Results
The extract increased the time spent in the brightly-lit chamber of the light/dark box, as well as in the number of times the animal crossed from one compartment to the other. Performance on the rota rod was unaffected. In the hole board test, the extract significantly increased both head-dip counts and head-dip duration. Urtica urens, in contrast to diazepam, had no effect on locomotion.

Conclusions
These results provides support for anxiolytic activity of Urtica urens, in line with its medicinal traditional use, and may also suggest a better side-effect profile of Urtica urens relative to diazepam.},

	abstract = {Background
Urtica dioica (UD) has been identified as a traditional herbal medicine. This study aimed to investigate the effect of UD extract and swimming activity on diabetic parameters through in vivo and in vitro experiments.

Methods
Adult WKY male rats were randomly distributed in nine groups: intact control, diabetic control, diabetic + 625 mg/kg, 1.25 g/kg UD, diabetic + 100 mg/kg Metformin, diabetic + swimming, diabetic + swimming 625 mg/kg, 1.25 g/kg UD, and diabetic +100 mg/kg Metformin + swimming. The hearts of the animals were punctured, and blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis. The entire pancreas was exposed for histologic examination. The effect of UD on insulin secretion by RIN-5F cells in 6.25 or 12.5 mM glucose dose was examined. Glucose uptake by cultured L6 myotubes was determined.

Results
The serum glucose concentration decreased, the insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity significantly increased in treated groups. These changes were more pronounced in the group that received UD extract and swimming training. Regeneration and less beta cell damage of Langerhans islets were observed in the treated groups. UD treatment increased insulin secretion in the RIN-5F cells and glucose uptake in the L6 myotubes cells.

Conclusions
Swimming exercises accompanied by consuming UD aqueous extracts effectively improved diabetic parameters, repaired pancreatic tissues in streptozotocin-induced diabetics in vivo, and increased glucose uptake or insulin in UD-treated cells in vitro.},

Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the effect of temperature and brewing time Urtica dioica L. infusions from different parts of this plant on vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content.
Material and methods: Infusions of nettle leaf, stem and root were prepared at room temperature, 50°C, 60°C, 70°C and 80°C for 10 minutes. Leaf infusions were also brewed for 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes at initial water temperature of 60°C. The amount of vitamin C was determined by the spectrophotometric method.
Results: The best temperature of brewing nettle infusions, in terms of vitamin C concentration, is between 50 °C and 60 °C as it is sufficient to extract the substance, yet not high enough to destroy it.
Conclusions: The optimal time of brewing appeared to be 10 minutes as the prolonged exposure to high temperature appeared to be detrimental for ascorbic acid as well.},

	abstract = {Introduction The phytoalimurgic plants, common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), corn poppy (Papaver rhoeas) and stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) are a source of nutraceuticals. Objectives To apply a combined metabolomic fingerprinting approach by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) to common dandelion, corn poppy and stinging nettles to obtain simultaneous identification and quantitation of the major classes of organic compounds. Methodology The whole plants collected in the Cilento National Park were dried and then extracted to obtain non-polar and polar organic extracts. GC–MS was used for non-polar extracts while 1H-NMR spectroscopy was used for polar extracts. In both cases, simultaneous identification and quantification of the bioactive metabolites was obtained. Results Non-polar organic extracts of all plants were mainly composed of palmitic, stearic and oleic acids. The two pentacyclic triterpenols α- and β-amyrin were detected in nettle extract. The analysis of polar organic extracts allowed to detect and quantify organic acids and sugars as main metabolites along with amino acids, caffeoyl derivatives, flavonoids, and nucleotides. In particular, corn poppy leaves contained a huge amount of glyceric acid (55.7\% of the total extract). Stinging nettles, instead, exhibited a large amount of choline (19.5\%). Conclusion Metabolomic approach coupling GC–MS with NMR spectroscopy allowed to provide a detailed metabolite profile of three alimurgic plants, common dandelion, corn poppy and stinging nettle, from both a qualitative and quantitative point of view.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a new way to compact a continuous probability distribution \$F\$ into a set of representative points called support points. These points are obtained by minimizing the energy distance, a statistical potential measure initially proposed by Székely and Rizzo [InterStat 5 (2004) 1–6] for testing goodness-of-fit. The energy distance has two appealing features. First, its distance-based structure allows us to exploit the duality between powers of the Euclidean distance and its Fourier transform for theoretical analysis. Using this duality, we show that support points converge in distribution to \$F\$, and enjoy an improved error rate to Monte Carlo for integrating a large class of functions. Second, the minimization of the energy distance can be formulated as a difference-of-convex program, which we manipulate using two algorithms to efficiently generate representative point sets. In simulation studies, support points provide improved integration performance to both Monte Carlo and a specific quasi-Monte Carlo method. Two important applications of support points are then highlighted: (a) as a way to quantify the propagation of uncertainty in expensive simulations and (b) as a method to optimally compact Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples in Bayesian computation.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the mechanical and material properties of hyphae, the single constituent material of Agaricomycetes fungi, despite a growing interest in fungus-based materials. In the Agaricomycetes (the mushrooms and allies), there are three types of hyphae that make up sporocarps: generative, skeletal, and ligative. All filamentous Agaricomycetes can be categorized into one of three categories of hyphal systems that compose them: monomitic, dimitic, and trimitic. Monomitic systems have only generative hyphae. Dimitic systems have generative and either skeletal (most common) or ligative. Trimitic systems are composed of all three kinds of hyphae. SEM imaging, compression testing, and theoretical modeling were used to characterize the material and mechanical properties of representative monomitic, dimitic, and trimitic sporocarps. Compression testing revealed an increase in the compression modulus and compressive strength with the addition of more hyphal types (monomitic to dimitic and dimitic to trimitic). The mesostructure of the trimitic sporocarp was tested and modeled, suggesting that the difference in properties between the solid material and the microtubule mesostructure is a result of differences in structure and not material. Theoretical modeling was completed to estimate the mechanical properties of the individual types of hyphae and showed that skeletal hyphae make the largest contribution to mechanical properties of fungal sporocarps. Understanding the contributions of the different types of hyphae may help in the design and application of fungi-based or bioinspired materials.
Statement of Significance
This research studies the material and mechanical properties of fungal sporocarps and their hyphae, the single constituent material of Agaricomycetes fungi. Though some work has been done on fungal hyphae, this research studies hyphae in context of the three hyphal systems found in Agaricomycetes fungi and estimates the properties of the hyphal filaments, which has not been done previously. This characterization was performed by analyzing the structures and mechanical properties of fungal sporocarps and calculating the theoretical mechanical properties of their hyphae. This data and the resulting conclusions may lead to a better design and implementation process of fungi-based materials in various applications using the properties now known or calculated.},

	title = {Random {Search} for {Hyper}-{Parameter} {Optimization}},
	abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efﬁcient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to conﬁgure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks conﬁgured by a pure grid search, we ﬁnd that random search over the same domain is able to ﬁnd models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search ﬁnds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising conﬁguration space. Compared with deep belief networks conﬁgured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional conﬁguration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for conﬁguring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent “High Throughput” methods achieve surprising success—they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

Thanks to natural language processing, the primary data are based on a text book for mushroom identification and contain 173 species from 23 families. While the secondary data comprise simulated or hypothetical entries that are structurally comparable to the 1987 data, it serves as pilot data for classification tasks. We evaluated different machine learning algorithms, namely, naive Bayes, logistic regression, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and random forests (RF). We found that the RF provided the best results with a five-fold Cross-Validation accuracy and F2-score of 1.0 (\$\${\textbackslash}mu =1\$\$, \$\${\textbackslash}sigma =0\$\$), respectively. The results of our pilot are conclusive and indicate that our data were not linearly separable. Unlike the 1987 data which showed good results using a linear decision boundary with the LDA.

	abstract = {In the computer experiments setting, if the relationship between the response and the inputs is unknown, then the purpose is to use designs that spread the points at which the response is observed evenly throughout the region. These designs are called space-ﬁlling designs (SFD) and the most known are Latin Hypercubes (random, orthogonal, optimized) and low discrepancy sequences. But, simulation codes becoming more and more complex, high dimensional optimal designs are needed to study a high number of parameters (more than 20 parameters) and the construction proves difﬁcult. The aim of this study is to explore a construction method of new space-ﬁlling designs for high dimensional spaces. After a short presentation of the criteria considered to quantify the intrinsic quality of the designs, the generation of these designs using WSP algorithm is presented. As the ﬁrst step consists in generating candidate points, the inﬂuence of the initial set of points is investigated in dimension 20 and the ﬁnal designs are compared with others space-ﬁlling designs. Then, designs are proposed in dimension 20, 30, 40 and 50 and the study of the intrinsic quality of these new space-ﬁlling designs highlights the robustness of this generation method in high dimensional spaces.},

	abstract = {Established approaches for analyzing meta-analyses of diagnostic accuracy model the bivariate distribution of the observed pairs of specificity Sp and sensitivity Se, thus accounting for across-study correlation. However, it is still a matter of debate how to define a summary ROC (SROC) curve. It was recently pointed out that the SROC curve is in principle unidentifiable if only one (Sp, Se) pair per study is known. We evaluate an alternative approach, modeling the study-specific ROC curves based on the assumption of linearity in logit space. A setting is considered in which the pair (Sp, Se) that is selected for publication in a particular study maximizes a weighted Youden index λSe+(1−λ)Sp with a given weight λ.This leads to a fixed slope (1−λ)/λ of the ROC curve in (1−Sp, Se), equivalent to a slope of (1−λ)Sp(1−Sp)/(λSe(1−Se)) for the corresponding straight line in logit space. While the slope depends on the variance ratio of the underlying distributions, the intercept is a function of the mean difference. Our approach leads in a natural way to a new, model-based proposal for a summary ROC curve. It is illustrated using an example from the literature. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first-order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics. These procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the epidemiological literature.},

	abstract = {When faced with situations involving high-dimensional data, it is natural to consider the possibility of projecting those data onto a lower-dimensional subspace without losing important information regarding some characteristic of the original variables. One way of accomplishing this reduction of dimensionality is through variable selection, also called feature selection (see Section 5.7). Another way is by creating a reduced set of linear or nonlinear transformations of the input variables. The creation of such composite variables (or features) by projection methods is often referred to as feature extraction. Usually, we wish to find those low-dimensional projections of the input data that enjoy some sort of optimality properties.},

Similarly to PCA, these two objectives can be solved by solving an eigenvalue problem with the corresponding eigenvector defining the hyperplane of interest. This hyperplane can be used for classification, dimensionality reduction and for interpretation of the importance of the given features. In the first part of the chapter we discuss the generic formulation of LDA whereas in the second we present the robust counterpart scheme originally proposed by Kim and Boyd. We also discuss the non linear extension of LDA through the kernel transformation.},

It has application in several areas of engineering. It is popular from computational perspective as it requires only an eigendecomposition or singular value decomposition. There are two alternative optimization approaches for obtaining principal component analysis solution, the one of variance maximization and the one of minimum error formulation. Both start with a “different” initial objective and end up providing the same solution. It is necessary to study and understand both of these alternative approaches. In the second part of this chapter we present the robust counterpart formulation of PCA and demonstrate how such a formulation can be used in practice in order to produce sparse solutions.},

	abstract = {This chapter deals with latent variables modeling and dimensionality reduction techniques. It starts with the more classical principle components analysis (PCA) method. Its various properties are analyzed and its interpretation as a low-rank matrix factorization is emphasized. Then, the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and its relatives, such as partial least-squares (PLS) are introduced. Independent component analysis (ICA) is reviewed and the cocktail party problem is presented. Dictionary learning, as a matrix factorization approach, is defined and the k-SVD algorithm is considered. The probabilistic approach to latent variables modeling is reviewed, starting with the factor analysis method and moves on to discuss probabilistic PCA and the method of mixture of factor analyzers, as a Bayesian alternative to compressed sensing. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, including kernel PCA, Laplacian eigenmaps, local linear embedding (LLE), and isometric mapping (ISOPAM) are considered. Matrix completion and robust PCA are introduced and related applications are discussed. Finally, the chapter concludes with a case study concerning fMRI data-analysis.},

The orthogonality theorem concerning random variables is introduced as an alternative for their derivation. Issues concerning complex random variables, such as widely-linear estimation and Wirtinger’s calculus are presented. Some typical applications of MSE, such as image deblurring, interference cancellation, system identification and channel equalization are defined. Issues related to the efficient solution of the normal equations in the context of linear filtering are discussed and the Levinson and lattice-ladder algorithms are derived. The Gauss-Markov theorem for MSE of linear models is provided and the case of constrained estimation in the context of beamforming is introduced. The chapter concludes with the introduction and derivation of Kalman filtering.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.},

	abstract = {The coarse-scale population structure of pathogenic Armillaria (Fr.) Staude species was determined on approximately 16 100 ha Of relatively dry, mixed-conifer forest in the Blue Mountains of northeast Oregon. Sampling of recently dead or live, symptomatic conifers produced 112 isolates of Armillaria from six tree species. Armillaria species identifications done by using a polymerase chain reaction based diagnostic and diploid-diploid pairings produced identical results: 108 of the isolates were Armillaria ostoyae (Romagn.) Herink and four were North American Biological Species X (NABS X). Five genets of A. ostoyae and one of NABS X were identified through the use of somatic incompatibility pairings among the putatively diploid isolates. Armillaria ostoyae genet sizes were approximately 20, 95, 195, 260, and 965 ha; cumulative colonization of the study area was at least 9.5\%. The maximum distance between isolates from the 965-ha A. ostoyae genet was approximately 3810 m, and use of three estimates of A. ostoyae spread rate in conifer forests resulted in age estimates for the genet ranging from 1900 to 8650 years. Results are discussed in relation to possible mechanisms that influenced the establishment, expansion, and expression of these genets; the genetic structure and stability of Armillaria; and the implications for disease management in this and similar forests.},
