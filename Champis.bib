	abstract = {This paper introduces a new way to compact a continuous probability distribution \$F\$ into a set of representative points called support points. These points are obtained by minimizing the energy distance, a statistical potential measure initially proposed by Székely and Rizzo [InterStat 5 (2004) 1–6] for testing goodness-of-fit. The energy distance has two appealing features. First, its distance-based structure allows us to exploit the duality between powers of the Euclidean distance and its Fourier transform for theoretical analysis. Using this duality, we show that support points converge in distribution to \$F\$, and enjoy an improved error rate to Monte Carlo for integrating a large class of functions. Second, the minimization of the energy distance can be formulated as a difference-of-convex program, which we manipulate using two algorithms to efficiently generate representative point sets. In simulation studies, support points provide improved integration performance to both Monte Carlo and a specific quasi-Monte Carlo method. Two important applications of support points are then highlighted: (a) as a way to quantify the propagation of uncertainty in expensive simulations and (b) as a method to optimally compact Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples in Bayesian computation.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the mechanical and material properties of hyphae, the single constituent material of Agaricomycetes fungi, despite a growing interest in fungus-based materials. In the Agaricomycetes (the mushrooms and allies), there are three types of hyphae that make up sporocarps: generative, skeletal, and ligative. All filamentous Agaricomycetes can be categorized into one of three categories of hyphal systems that compose them: monomitic, dimitic, and trimitic. Monomitic systems have only generative hyphae. Dimitic systems have generative and either skeletal (most common) or ligative. Trimitic systems are composed of all three kinds of hyphae. SEM imaging, compression testing, and theoretical modeling were used to characterize the material and mechanical properties of representative monomitic, dimitic, and trimitic sporocarps. Compression testing revealed an increase in the compression modulus and compressive strength with the addition of more hyphal types (monomitic to dimitic and dimitic to trimitic). The mesostructure of the trimitic sporocarp was tested and modeled, suggesting that the difference in properties between the solid material and the microtubule mesostructure is a result of differences in structure and not material. Theoretical modeling was completed to estimate the mechanical properties of the individual types of hyphae and showed that skeletal hyphae make the largest contribution to mechanical properties of fungal sporocarps. Understanding the contributions of the different types of hyphae may help in the design and application of fungi-based or bioinspired materials.
Statement of Significance
This research studies the material and mechanical properties of fungal sporocarps and their hyphae, the single constituent material of Agaricomycetes fungi. Though some work has been done on fungal hyphae, this research studies hyphae in context of the three hyphal systems found in Agaricomycetes fungi and estimates the properties of the hyphal filaments, which has not been done previously. This characterization was performed by analyzing the structures and mechanical properties of fungal sporocarps and calculating the theoretical mechanical properties of their hyphae. This data and the resulting conclusions may lead to a better design and implementation process of fungi-based materials in various applications using the properties now known or calculated.},

The pressurization of hyphae by osmosis is often considered an important feature of the tip growth process. But although the hydrostatic pressure within the cytoplasm smooths the expanding surface of these cells, there is little evidence that high levels of turgor are necessary for growth until the hypha encounters friction from its surroundings. Research on movement and growth processes in other kinds of cells, including amoebae and pollen tubes, has done a great deal to inform recent studies on hyphae. Experiments on pressure waves and rhythmic or pulsatile growth are particularly significant and are discussed in relation to the erratic extension rate of hyphae. Significant findings have also come from research on the hyphal cytoskeleton and on the biomechanics of invasive growth. It has been clear for some time that turgor powers the propulsion of hyphae through solid materials and experiments using new techniques have quantified the relevant forces.},

@article{bergstra_random_nodate,
	title = {Random {Search} for {Hyper}-{Parameter} {Optimization}},
	abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efﬁcient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to conﬁgure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks conﬁgured by a pure grid search, we ﬁnd that random search over the same domain is able to ﬁnd models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search ﬁnds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising conﬁguration space. Compared with deep belief networks conﬁgured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional conﬁguration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for conﬁguring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent “High Throughput” methods achieve surprising success—they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

Thanks to natural language processing, the primary data are based on a text book for mushroom identification and contain 173 species from 23 families. While the secondary data comprise simulated or hypothetical entries that are structurally comparable to the 1987 data, it serves as pilot data for classification tasks. We evaluated different machine learning algorithms, namely, naive Bayes, logistic regression, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and random forests (RF). We found that the RF provided the best results with a five-fold Cross-Validation accuracy and F2-score of 1.0 (\$\${\textbackslash}mu =1\$\$, \$\${\textbackslash}sigma =0\$\$), respectively. The results of our pilot are conclusive and indicate that our data were not linearly separable. Unlike the 1987 data which showed good results using a linear decision boundary with the LDA. Our data set contains 23 families and is the largest available. We further provide a fully reproducible workflow and provide the data under the FAIR principles.},

But, simulation codes becoming more and more complex, high dimensional optimal designs are needed to study a high number of parameters (more than 20 parameters) and the construction proves difﬁcult. The aim of this study is to explore a construction method of new space-ﬁlling designs for high dimensional spaces. After a short presentation of the criteria considered to quantify the intrinsic quality of the designs, the generation of these designs using WSP algorithm is presented. As the ﬁrst step consists in generating candidate points, the inﬂuence of the initial set of points is investigated in dimension 20 and the ﬁnal designs are compared with others space-ﬁlling designs.

	abstract = {Established approaches for analyzing meta-analyses of diagnostic accuracy model the bivariate distribution of the observed pairs of specificity Sp and sensitivity Se, thus accounting for across-study correlation. However, it is still a matter of debate how to define a summary ROC (SROC) curve. It was recently pointed out that the SROC curve is in principle unidentifiable if only one (Sp, Se) pair per study is known. We evaluate an alternative approach, modeling the study-specific ROC curves based on the assumption of linearity in logit space. A setting is considered in which the pair (Sp, Se) that is selected for publication in a particular study maximizes a weighted Youden index λSe+(1−λ)Sp with a given weight λ.This leads to a fixed slope (1−λ)/λ of the ROC curve in (1−Sp, Se), equivalent to a slope of (1−λ)Sp(1−Sp)/(λSe(1−Se)) for the corresponding straight line in logit space. While the slope depends on the variance ratio of the underlying distributions, the intercept is a function of the mean difference. Our approach leads in a natural way to a new, model-based proposal for a summary ROC curve. It is illustrated using an example from the literature. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
